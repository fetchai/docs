# Governance

If you wish to take part in governance, you either need to be running a full validator node or you need to have have delegated stake to an existing validator.

## Stake delegation

If you want to delegate stake to a validator the following command should be used:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx staking delegate <VALOPER_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> --from <KEY_NAME>
    ```

where the `<VALOPER_ADDRESS>` begins with the prefix `fetchvaloper1...` and the `<AMOUNT>` field contains the currency denomination.

For instance:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx staking delegate fetchvaloper1cct4fhhksplu9m9wjljuthjqhjj93z0s97p3g7 1000atestfet --from agent
    ```

## Proposals overview

There are three types of proposal:

    1. **Text proposals**: These are the most basic type of proposal. They can be used to get the opinion from participants of the network on a given topic.
    2. **Parameter proposals**: These proposals are used to update the value of an existing software parameter of the network.
    3. **Software upgrade proposals**: These are used to propose an upgrade of the `fetchd` software, particularly in cases where the software changes might not necessary be backwards compatible or in some way present a major update to the network.

## The proposal process

**Any FET holder can submit a proposal**.

In order for the proposal to be open for voting, it needs to come with a deposit that is greater than a parameter called _minDeposit_. The deposit need not be provided in its entirety by the submitter. If the initial proposer's deposit is not sufficient, the proposal enters the **deposit period** status. Then, any FET holder can increase the deposit by sending a _depositTx_ transaction to the network.

Once the deposit reaches _minDeposit_, the proposal enters the **voting period**, which lasts 2 weeks. Any bonded FET holder can then cast a vote on this proposal. The user has the following options for voting:

    * Yes
    * No
    * NoWithVeto
    * Abstain

At the end of the voting period, the proposal is accepted if there are **more than 50% Yes votes** (excluding Abstain votes) and **less than 33.33% of NoWithVeto votes** (excluding Abstain votes).

## Generating proposals

When creating a proposal, the user will create a proposal **JSON file** with all the relevant information.

An example of a **text proposal** is shown below:

    ```json
    {
      "title": "Switch to semantic commit messages for fetchd",
      "description": "This proposal is advocating a switch to sematic commit messages\nYou can find the full discussion here: https://github.com/fetchai/fetchd/issues/231",
      "type": "Text",
      "deposit": "10000000000000000000atestfet"
    }
    ```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  It is always recommended that the description of a text proposal has a link to a Github issue with the full proposal text along with the discussions about it.
</Callout>

After having created the JSON file, **the user can generate the text proposal on chain** by running the following command:

    `fetchd tx gov submit-proposal --proposal proposal.json --from <name of signing key>`

## Increasing the deposit for a proposal

If a user wants to **increase the deposit of a proposal**, they would run the following command:

    `fetchd tx gov deposit <proposalID> 100atestfet --from <key name>`

For example:

    `fetchd tx gov deposit 2 100atestfet --from validator`

To get the **proposalID**, use the **txhash** obtained when the proposal was submitted and run the following command:

    `fetchd query tx <txhash>`

## Listing current proposals

Current proposals are visible from the block explorer and using the CLI.

If you wish to get the list of current proposals and their corresponding _proposal-ids_ the run the following command:

    `fetchd query gov proposals`

## Voting on a proposal

If you want to vote for a proposal, run the following command:

    `fetchd tx gov vote <proposalID> <option> --from <delegatorKeyName>`

For instance:

    `fetchd tx gov vote 5 yes --from validator`
