# Agents 101

## Overview

Welcome to **Agents 101**! This course is designed to introduce you to the development of Agents, providing a comprehensive guide from foundational concepts to practical implementation. Whether you're a beginner in programming or an experienced developer, this course caters to various skill levels, offering a pathway to create increasingly sophisticated Agents and explore diverse use cases.

If you encounter uncertainties or have questions about specific terms or topics throughout the course, our support team is available on [Discord ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://discord.gg/fetchai) to assist you.

## Introduction to Agents

In this course, you'll delve into the world of Agents using the [uAgents Framework ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agents/agents). Agents are  programs able to operate autonomously within decentralized landscapes, aligned with user-defined objectives. These agents have the ability to connect, search, transact, establish dynamic markets and so on. By leveraging artificial intelligence, API calls, blockchain technology, and business logic, Agents automate multiple workflows. The aim is to facilitate interactions with their environment and other networked agents without human intervention.

## Set up your development environment üõ†Ô∏è
### Prerequisites

Before embarking on this course, ensure your machine meets the following requirements:

    1. **Python 3.8+**: download and install Python from [Python's official website ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    2. **Preferred IDE**: Visual Studio Code or PyCharm (alternative options like Notepad are feasible).

### Set up development tools
#### Installing Homebrew

**Homebrew** streamlines software installations on MacOS via the command line. To install and update Homebrew, execute the following commands:

    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

You can verify it [here ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://brew.sh/). Let's then ensure Homebrew is updated:

    ```
    brew update
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      For more information on Homebrew explore their [website ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://brew.sh/).
    </Callout>

#### Installing PyEnv

Now, you need to install **PyEnv**. It is a simple tool to manage multiple versions of Python. Run:

    ```
    brew install pyenv
    ```

Once you have installed PyEnv you can configure the shell environment:

    ```
    echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      These commands configure your shell environment (specifically the **Zsh shell**) to work with PyEnv. These commands set up environment variables, modify the PATH, and initialize PyEnv so that you can easily manage and switch between different Python versions. You can verify all steps [here ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).
    </Callout>

You are now ready to **install Python** if you haven't done it yet. You need to install a version of Python 3.8 or above (for this example, we use version 3.10):

    ```
    pyenv install 3.10
    ```

You can get help or check a command insights by running:

    ```
    pyenv help
    ```

Let's now ensure the **global version of Python** you are working with is not the default one in the system. Run:

    ```
    pyenv global 3.10 # this sets the global interpreter
    pyenv versions # this verifies if it is set up correctly
    ```

#### Installing Poetry

You now need to install **Poetry**. Poetry is used for managing Python project dependencies, handling virtual environments, packaging, and publishing Python libraries or applications.

You can install Poetry by running the following command:

    ```
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      If you would like to learn more about Poetry, visit the [website ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for further information.
    </Callout>

#### Initialize your project with Poetry

You now have all necessary tools installed. You are ready to initialize your project! Let's create a working directory and initialize Poetry üéâ.

First, you need to create a working directory for your project using `mkdir` command. Then, you will need to change directory to this one, using `cd` command:

    ```
    mkdir development/agent-demo
    cd development/agent-demo
    ```

You can ensure you are in the correct directory by checking your current path:

    ```
    pwd
    # Example output: /Users/Jessica/Documents
    ```

If you are happy with the install location for the project, go ahead and **initialize Poetry**:

    ```
    poetry init
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      Follow the setup wizard to provide details including project name, version, author, license, and select dependencies (e.g., `uagents`).
    </Callout>

Once you complete the initialization, run:

    ```
    poetry install
    ```

This command will install the dependencies specified in the **pyproject.toml** file.

**Congratulations! You've completed the installation process. You're now all set to embark on creating your first AI Agent!**

## Overview of the uAgents Framework

The [uAgents Framework ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agents/agents) provides the essential infrastructure for creating and deploying Agents within Fetch.ai Ecosystem. It offers a comprehensive toolkit, protocols, and functionalities crucial for developing autonomous agents. The uAgents Framework is integrated with several components of the Fetch.ai Ecosystem, including the [AI Engine ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro), the [Almanac contract ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview) and the [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro).

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      Check out the official [uAgents Python package ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/) and start developing your ideas using this library!

      Current version of the uAgents package is <PackageVersion packageName="uagents" packageType="pypi" />.
    </Callout>

### Core concepts
#### Addresses

Agents are identified by **two types of addresses**, serving as identifiers for each agent within the Fetch.ai Ecosystem:

    1. **uAgent Address**: the primary agent identifier; it allows it to interact with other agents, exchange messages, and participate in decentralized network activities

    2. **Fetch Address**: this cryptographic public address is linked to the agent and its wallet on the Fetch.ai blockchain; it enables various functionalities, including interacting with the [Fetch ledger ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/intro), registering in the Almanac contract and performing operations, including token or asset transfers on the blockchain.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      Check out the [Getting an agent addresses ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/getting-uagent-address) guide to learn more on this topic.
    </Callout>

#### Storage

Agents can store information in **JSON files** that they can freely retrieve when needed. Storage plays a critical role in maintaining agent state, retaining past interactions, and facilitating informed decision-making based on historical data.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      Discover more about agents' storage functions through our [Using agents storage function ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/storage-function) guide or the [agents storage ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/storage) documentation. If you are new to JSON, please see an example [here ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp).
    </Callout>

#### Protocols

The uAgents Framework provides comprehensive support for the organization of message types and their handlers within **protocols**. Protocols are sets of rules that govern the transmission, reception and interpretation of data between agents. They define the communication format, timing, sequence and error handling. Protocols enable standardized communication and ensure accurate and reliable data exchange. Agents using the same protocol can communicate directly with each other.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      If you want to become an expert in Fetch.ai's agent technology, we strongly recommend that you check our [protocols ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/agent-protocols) documentation.
    </Callout>

#### Exchange protocol

The **Exchange Protocol** facilitates efficient communication between agents by using standardized messaging techniques. Messages are packed in envelopes which are encoded and transmitted to specific endpoints via HTTP. Messages consist of key-value pairs (in JSON format) and are packed in envelopes with metadata. **Envelopes** contain:

    - Sender and recipient addresses.
    - Message schema.
    - Payload.
    - Expiration time.
    - Signature for authentication.

The exchange protocol uses a standardized `HTTP 1.1 POST /submit` endpoint for message processing and expects JSON formatted data. These details ensure consistent and standardized communication within the Fetch.Agents ecosystem.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      For more information, see our [Exchange Protocol ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/exchange-protocol) documentation.
    </Callout>

#### Almanac contract, registering, searching and discovery

The [Almanac ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview) contract is an important component in Fetch.ai Ecosystem. It operates as a blockchain-based repository where agents register, exchange information and establish communication. Registration in the Almanac is mandatory so that agents can participate in remote interactions and become discoverable through the [Agentverse Explorer ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agent-services/agent-explorer).

Agents keep their registrations up-to-date within certain block limits to ensure the accuracy and relevance of their data. Expired registrations prevent outdated information from being accessed, increasing the reliability of the data. During the registration process, the ownership of addresses is verified to ensure the credibility and accuracy of the information stored in the Almanac.

The agents registered in the Almanac provide service endpoints for remote communication, which contain weighted parameters that enable effective interaction. As a central hub, the Almanac facilitates the discovery of endpoints based on these assigned weights. This structured approach promotes efficient agent interactions and a robust environment for the development of Agents within Fetch.ai's decentralized network.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      Check out the [Registering in the Almanac contract ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/register-in-almanac) guide and the [Registration and endpoints weighting ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/endpoints) for additional information on the registration process.
    </Callout>

## Coding and implementation
### Create your first agent

Creating your first agent is a straightforward process. First of all, we need to create a Python file for this example. We can do this by running:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
    ```py copy filename="mac"
    touch alice_agent.py
    ```
</DocsCode>
<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > alice_agent.py
    ```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch alice_agent.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>

We can now code our agent. Let's start by importing the required modules. In our case, we would need to import the `Agent` module from the `uagents` library, and proceed to instantiate the agent by providing a `name`. The following code exemplifies the creation of the simplest possible agent:

    ```py copy
    # Import the required classes
    from uagents import Agent

    # Initialize your first Agent and give it a name
    agent = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")
    ```

You can run this with `poetry run python alice_agent.py` but it won't do much, yet!

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      If you're not too familiar with classes in Python, take a look [w3schools Python classes ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp).
    </Callout>

### Create a second agent and start an interaction

Let's get Alice to do something! We're going to get Alice, on start up, to introduce itself and provide its address by printing both, on the terminal window. We can add a `on_event("startup")` decorator to make the agent run the defined function when it is run.

Let's update `alice_agent.py` with the code snippet below:

    ```py copy
    # Import the required classes
    from uagents import Agent, Context

    agent = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")

    # Provide your Agent with a job
    @agent.on_event("startup")
    async def introduce_agent(ctx: Context):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Hello, I'm agent {agent.name} and my address is {agent.address}.")

    # This constructor simply ensure that only this script is running
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent.run()
    ```

Decorators are moderately advanced in Python, but in this guide all you need to know is that they're there so that the agent knows how to act on the declared decorated functions.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      To find out more about decorators, take a look at [Primer on Python decorators ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/).
    </Callout>

In our example above, the `on_event()` decorator specifies that the agent should run an `introduce_agent()` function when the agent starts up. This function will then return a message presenting the agent with its name and address by using the `Context` class, which is used to retrieve the agent's related name and address using the `agent.name` and `agent.address` methods.

Let's run the `alice_agent.py` script again. Run: `poetry run python alice_agent.py`

This time, the output will be:

    ```
    Hello, I'm agent alice and my address is agent1qww3ju3h6kfcuqf54gkghvt2pqe8qp97a7nzm2vp8plfxflc0epzcjsv79t.
    ```

### Printing agent's addresses

Sometimes, we just need to see what a value looks like. We can quickly do so in Python by using the `print()` in-built function. As we have mentioned earlier, every AI Agent is identified by two addresses within the uAgents Framework: **uAgent** and **Fetch Network** addresses. We have showed above how to check for an uAgent address using the `agent.address` method of the `Context` class. Let's now print them in the console to see their differences using the `print()` function:

    ```py copy
    from uagents import Agent

    agent = Agent(name="alice")

    print("uAgent address: ", agent.address)
    print("Fetch network address: ", agent.wallet.address())
    ```

The output of the above would look similar to:

    ```
    uAgent address: agent1qww3ju3h6kfcuqf54gkghvt2pqe8qp97a7nzm2vp8plfxflc0epzcjsv79t
    Fetch network address: fetch1454hu0n9eszzg8p7mvan3ep7484jxl5mkf9phg
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      Check out our [Getting an agent addresses ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/getting-uagent-address) guide for an in-depth understanding of these topics.
    </Callout>

### Agents and interval tasks

**Interval tasks** are tasks or set of instructions executed at predefined time intervals. These are useful for automating repetitive tasks, scheduling background processes, or managing periodic activities in applications. Setting up interval tasks for agents is a great way to harness their potential and streamline processes including bidding, searching, data processing, job scheduling and more.

If you want to create an interval task, you need to use an `on_interval()` decorator to set up an interval with a timer that triggers the task repetition. As an introductory example, we can consider an agent periodically printing hello and its name on the console. In this case, we apply the decorator to a `say_hello()` function which will be repeated at the specified time interval:

    ```py copy
    from uagents import Agent, Context

    agent = Agent(name="agent", seed="alice recovery phrase")

    @agent.on_interval(period=2.0)
    async def say_hello(ctx: Context):
        ctx.logger.info(f'hello, my name is {agent.name}')

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent.run()
    ```

The output will be printed on your terminal every 2 seconds using the `ctx.logger.info()` method of the `Context` class.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      The `Context` class in the `uagents` library plays a central role by overseeing message handling and serving as a central hub for essential agent functionalities such as storage, wallet, ledger, and identity management.
    </Callout>

The output would look as follows:

    ```
    hello, my name is agent
    hello, my name is agent
    hello, my name is agent
    ```

### Agent interactions and interval tasks

We can now introduce a second agent to demonstrate how two agents can interact with one another. Considering the previous example, we create two agents, each one with a name and seed phrase, and enable them to periodically engage with each other. We need to introduce the `Bureau` class which enables agents, within the same program, to be run together from the same script.

Let's create a new Python file for these agents:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
    ```py copy filename="mac"
    touch duo_agent.py
    ```
</DocsCode>
<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > duo_agent.py
    ```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch duo_agent.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>

The script will look as follows:

    ```py copy
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Bureau

    alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")
    bob = Agent(name="bob", seed="bob recovery phrase")

    @alice.on_interval(period=2.0)
    async def say_hello(ctx: Context):
        ctx.logger.info(f'Hello, my name is {alice.name}')

    @bob.on_interval(period=2.0)
    async def say_hello(ctx: Context):
        ctx.logger.info(f'Hello, my name is {bob.name}')

    bureau = Bureau()
    bureau.add(alice)
    bureau.add(bob)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        bureau.run()
    ```

You can now run the script: `poetry run python duo_agent.py`.

The output would look as follows:

    ```
    [alice] Hello, my name is alice
    [  bob] Hello, my name is bob
    [alice] Hello, my name is alice
    [  bob] Hello, my name is bob
    [alice] Hello, my name is alice
    [  bob] Hello, my name is bob
    ```

### Agent communication

We can now show how to enable effective communication between different agents. To do so, we need to introduce the `Model` class which allows to create a structured message format for messages to be exchanged between the agents.

Let's create a new script for this example:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
    ```py copy filename="mac"
    touch agent_communication.py
    ```
</DocsCode>
<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > agent_communication.py
    ```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch agent_communication.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>

We can now define the `Message` data model and our two agents:

    ```py copy
    from uagents import Agent, Bureau, Context, Model

    class Message(Model):
        message: str

    alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")
    bob = Agent(name="bob", seed="bob recovery phrase")
    ```

We need to define a function for `alice` to send messages to `bob` periodically. We can do this by defining a `send_message()` function using the `Context` class and make `alice` send a message to `bob` on an interval:

    ```py copy
    @alice.on_interval(period=3.0)
    async def send_message(ctx: Context):
        await ctx.send(bob.address, Message(message="hello there bob"))
    ```

We then need a way for `bob` to receive these messages. We can do this by creating a function for `bob` to handle all incoming messages from other agents.  We can do this with a `on_message()` decorator that will activate the `message_handler()` function once `bob` receives a message matching the `Message` data model we previously defined:

    ```py copy
    @bob.on_message(model=Message)
    async def bob_message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")
        await ctx.send(alice.address, Message(message="hello there alice"))
    ```

We then need to define a message handler function for `alice` to handle response messages from `bob`. We do so using a `on_message()` decorator:

    ```py copy
    @alice.on_message(model=Message)
    async def alice_message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")
    ```

Finally, we need to add both agents to the `Bureau` in order to run them from the same script:

    ```py copy
    bureau = Bureau()
    bureau.add(alice)
    bureau.add(bob)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        bureau.run()
    ```

We can now run the script. Just run: `poetry run python agent_communication.py` in your terminal.

The output would look as follows:

    ```
    [alice]: Received message from agent1q0mau8vkmg78xx0sh8cyl4tpl4ktx94pqp2e94cylu6haugt2hd7j9vequ7: hello there alice
    [  bob]: Received message from agent1qww3ju3h6kfcuqf54gkghvt2pqe8qp97a7nzm2vp8plfxflc0epzcjsv79t: hello there bob
    [alice]: Received message from agent1q0mau8vkmg78xx0sh8cyl4tpl4ktx94pqp2e94cylu6haugt2hd7j9vequ7: hello there alice
    [  bob]: Received message from agent1qww3ju3h6kfcuqf54gkghvt2pqe8qp97a7nzm2vp8plfxflc0epzcjsv79t: hello there bob
    [alice]: Received message from agent1q0mau8vkmg78xx0sh8cyl4tpl4ktx94pqp2e94cylu6haugt2hd7j9vequ7: hello there alice
    [ bob]: Received message from agent1qww3ju3h6kfcuqf54gkghvt2pqe8qp97a7nzm2vp8plfxflc0epzcjsv79t: hello there bob
    ```

### Enabling search and discovery for your Agent (Almanac registration)

Agent registration in the Almanac contract is a key feature which enables discoverability of agents as well enabled remote agent communication. To register, agents must pay a small fee. Therefore your agents need to have funds available in their Fetch wallet address. Luckily in this demo we utilize the testnet environment to simulate real world transactions.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      When using the testnet, you can use the function `fund_agent_if_low()` to fund your agent.
    </Callout>

We first import modules, then initialize our agents and include a function ensuring that agents have non-zero balances in their wallets. This function will check if you have enough tokens to register in the Almanac. If not, it will add tokens to your Fetch wallet address. Agents can communicate by querying the Almanac and retrieving an HTTP [endpoint ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/endpoints) from the recipient agent. Therefore, we need to specify the service endpoints when defining an agent at registration.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) service endpoints are specific locations or URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) on a web server where clients can send HTTP requests to interact with resources or services provided by the server. These endpoints define the entry points for various operations or functions offered by a web service or application.
    </Callout>

Let's create a Python script for this example:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
    ```py copy filename="mac"
    touch almanac_registration.py
    ```
</DocsCode>
<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > almanac_registration.py
    ```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch almanac_registration.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>

We will have what follows:

    ```py copy filename="almanac_registration.py"
    from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Protocol

    agent = Agent(
        name="alice",
        port=8000,
        seed="alice secret phrase",
        endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
    )

    fund_agent_if_low(agent.wallet.address())

    @agent.on_interval(period=3)
    async def hi(ctx: Context):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Hello")

    agent.run()
    ```

Here, we defined a local http address but you could also define a remote address to allow agent communication over different machines through the internet. Importantly, make sure to add a seed phrase to your agent so you don't have to fund different addresses each time you run your agent.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      A seed phrase is a series of random words (typically 12 or 24) that provide the data needed to recover a lost or broken crypto wallet. It is also known as a mnemonic phrase and is best understood as a security measure for self-custody of digital assets. Agents have a crypto wallet address, and having the seed phrase enables the restoration of an agent's wallet address.
    </Callout>

To run the script use the `poetry run python almanac_registration.py` command.

### Remote agent communication

Agents can also interact **remotely**. To achieve a remote communication, we simply need an agent's address and query the rest of its information in the Almanac contract. You can create two agents operating on separate ports and terminals within the same device; this mirrors a real-world scenario in which agents communicate across different geographic locations.

In this example, we provide scripts for two agents. To establish a line of remote communication, both agents need to be registered on the Almanac contract and need to have non-zero balances in their Fetch wallet addresses.

We can start with `alice` agent. Let's create a Python script for it:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
    ```py copy filename="mac"
    touch remote_alice.py
    ```
</DocsCode>
<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > remote_alice.py
    ```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch remote_alice.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>

We first import the required modules. We then use the `Model` class to define a `Message` data model for messages to be exchanged between our agents. We also need to provide Bob's address as a recipient address for reference. We can then create our agent `alice`, by providing the needed information for registration. We need to make sure it has enough balance in its wallet. We then proceed and define its functions. Remember that you need to provide the `RECIPIENT_ADDRESS`, `name`, `port`, `seed` and `endpoint` parameters to correctly run this agent and code.

The script would be as follows:

    ```py copy filename="remote_alice.py"
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
    from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

    class Message(Model):
        message: str

    RECIPIENT_ADDRESS = "agent1q2kxet3vh0scsf0sm7y2erzz33cve6tv5uk63x64upw5g68kr0chkv7hw50"

    agent = Agent(
        name="alice",
        port=8000,
        seed="alice secret phrase",
        endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
    )

    fund_agent_if_low(agent.wallet.address())

    @agent.on_interval(period=2.0)
    async def send_message(ctx: Context):
        await ctx.send(RECIPIENT_ADDRESS, Message(message="hello there bob"))

    @agent.on_message(model=Message)
    async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent.run()
    ```

Similarly, we need to define a script for `bob` so to create a remote communication with `alice` agent. Let's create a Python script for it:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
    ```py copy filename="mac"
    touch remote_bob.py
    ```
</DocsCode>
<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > remote_bob.py
    ```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch remote_bob.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>

Instead of creating and manually writing out the same script we can copy and rename Alice's script and modify the agent's `name`, `seed`, `port`, decorator as well as the message content:

    ```py copy filename="remote_bob.py"
    from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Model

    class Message(Model):
        message: str

    agent = Agent(
        name="bob",
        port=8001,
        seed="bob secret phrase",
        endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit"],
    )

    fund_agent_if_low(agent.wallet.address())

    @agent.on_message(model=Message)
    async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

        await ctx.send(sender, Message(message="hello there alice"))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent.run()
    ```

Remember that you need to provide the `name`, `port`, `seed` and `endpoint` parameters to correctly run this agent!

In different terminal windows, first run `remote_bob.py` and then `remote_alice.py`. They will register automatically in the Almanac contract using their funds. The received messages will print out in each terminal. In order to run the two agents in parallel terminals use the `poetry run python remote_alice.py` and `poetry run python remote_bob.py`. The expected output would be:

    **Alice**:

        ```
        [alice]: Received message from agent1q2kxet3vh0scsf0sm7y2erzz33cve6tv5uk63x64upw5g68kr0chkv7hw50: hello there alice
        [alice]: Received message from agent1q2kxet3vh0scsf0sm7y2erzz33cve6tv5uk63x64upw5g68kr0chkv7hw50: hello there alice
        [alice]: Received message from agent1q2kxet3vh0scsf0sm7y2erzz33cve6tv5uk63x64upw5g68kr0chkv7hw50: hello there alice
        ```

    **Bob**:

        ```
        [  bob]: Received message from agent1qdp9j2ev86k3h5acaayjm8tpx36zv4mjxn05pa2kwesspstzj697xy5vk2a: hello there bob
        [  bob]: Received message from agent1qdp9j2ev86k3h5acaayjm8tpx36zv4mjxn05pa2kwesspstzj697xy5vk2a: hello there bob
        [  bob]: Received message from agent1qdp9j2ev86k3h5acaayjm8tpx36zv4mjxn05pa2kwesspstzj697xy5vk2a: hello there bob
        ```

### Agents and storage

Agents within the uAgents Framework have the ability to store information locally within a JSON file. This ensures data retrieval as needed. This storage functionality serves as a fundamental component for agents to maintain a state, recollect prior interactions, and base decisions on historical data.

The aim behind integrating storage features is to empower agents to preserve and leverage information over time, facilitating the recollection of past interactions and context for more informed decision-making. This capacity to learn from past experiences enables agents to adapt and refine their behavior and decision processes.

Retrieving or setting storage information within the Framework is achieved through two methods:

    - `ctx.storage.get()` for retrieval.
    - `ctx.storage.set()` for setting data.

An example is provided below. In this example we have a full script for an agent holding a number, incrementing it by one and saving the new number to its storage.

We first create the Python file containing the script. Run: 

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
    ```py copy filename="mac"
    touch storage.py
    ```
</DocsCode>
<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > storage.py
    ```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch storage.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>

The script for this example is:

    ```py copy filename="storage.py"
    from uagents import Agent, Context

    agent = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")

    @agent.on_interval(period=1.0)
    async def on_interval(ctx: Context):
        current_count = ctx.storage.get("count") or 0

        ctx.logger.info(f"My count is: {current_count}")

        ctx.storage.set("count", current_count + 1)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent.run()
    ```

We can then run the script: `poetry run python storage.py`
The output would be:

    ```
    [alice]: My count is: 1
    [alice]: My count is: 2
    [alice]: My count is: 3
    ...
    ```

### Booking a table at a restaurant

We now want to show how to set up the code to create a **restaurant booking service with two **Agents**: a `restaurant` with tables available and a `user` requesting a table availability.

We can do this by defining 2 specific **protocols**: one for table querying (i.e., `Table querying protocol`) and one for table booking (i.e., `Table booking protocol`). We then need to define two agents, `restaurant` and `user`, which will make use of the protocols to query and book a table.

We can start by writing the code for our two protocols.

#### Table querying protocol

Let's start by defining the protocol for querying availability of tables at the restaurant. We start by importing the necessary classes and defining the message data models for types of messages being handled. We then proceed and create an instance of the `Protocol` class and name it `query_proto`:

    ```py copy
    from typing import List

    from uagents import Context, Model, Protocol

    class TableStatus(Model):
        seats: int
        time_start: int
        time_end: int

    class QueryTableRequest(Model):
        guests: int
        time_start: int
        duration: int

    class QueryTableResponse(Model):
        tables: List[int]

    class GetTotalQueries(Model):
        pass

    class TotalQueries(Model):
        total_queries: int

    ```

Here, we defined different messages data models:

    - `TableStatus` represents the status of a table and includes the attributes number of seats, start time, and end time.
    - `QueryTableRequest` is used for querying table availability. It includes information about the number of guests, start time, and duration of the table request.
    - `QueryTableResponse` contains the response to the query table availability. It includes a list of table numbers that are available based on query parameters.
    - `GetTotalQueries` is used to request the total number of queries made to the system.
    - `TotalQueries` contains the response to the total queries request, including the count of total queries made to the system.

Let's then define the message handlers for the `query_proto` protocol:

    ```py copy
    query_proto = Protocol(name="RestaurantQueryProtocolExample", version="0.1.0")

    @query_proto.on_message(model=QueryTableRequest, replies=QueryTableResponse)
    async def handle_query_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: QueryTableRequest):
        tables = {
            int(num): TableStatus(**status)
            for (
                num,
                status,
            ) in ctx.storage._data.items()  # pylint: disable=protected-access
            if isinstance(num, int)
        }

        available_tables = []
        for number, status in tables.items():
            if (
                status.seats >= msg.guests
                and status.time_start <= msg.time_start
                and status.time_end >= msg.time_start + msg.duration
            ):
                available_tables.append(int(number))

        ctx.logger.info(f"Query: {msg}. Available tables: {available_tables}.")

        await ctx.send(sender, QueryTableResponse(tables=available_tables))

        total_queries = int(ctx.storage.get("total_queries") or 0)
        ctx.storage.set("total_queries", total_queries + 1)

    @query_proto.on_query(model=GetTotalQueries, replies=TotalQueries)
    async def handle_get_total_queries(ctx: Context, sender: str, _msg: GetTotalQueries):
        total_queries = int(ctx.storage.get("total_queries") or 0)
        await ctx.send(sender, TotalQueries(total_queries=total_queries))
    ```

    We define a protocol `query_proto` using the `Protocol` class of `uagents`. It is defined with a `name` and a `version`.

    The `handle_query_request()` function is the message handler function defined using the `on_message()` decorator. It handles the `QueryTableRequest` messages and replies with a `QueryTableResponse` message. The handler processes the table availability query based on the provided parameters, checks the table status stored in the agent's storage, and sends the available table numbers as a response to the querying agent.
    
    Additionally, the handler tracks the total number of queries made and increments the count in storage. On the other hand, `handle_get_total_queries()` is the message handler function defined using the `on_query()` decorator. It handles the `GetTotalQueries` query and replies with a `TotalQueries` message containing the total number of queries made to the system. The handler retrieves the total query count from the agent's storage and responds with the count.

The overall script should look as follows:

    ```py copy filename="query.py"
    from typing import List

    from uagents import Context, Model, Protocol

    class TableStatus(Model):
        seats: int
        time_start: int
        time_end: int

    class QueryTableRequest(Model):
        guests: int
        time_start: int
        duration: int

    class QueryTableResponse(Model):
        tables: List[int]

    class GetTotalQueries(Model):
        pass

    class TotalQueries(Model):
        total_queries: int

    query_proto = Protocol(name="RestaurantQueryProtocolExample", version="0.1.0")

    @query_proto.on_message(model=QueryTableRequest, replies=QueryTableResponse)
    async def handle_query_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: QueryTableRequest):
        tables = {
            int(num): TableStatus(**status)
            for (
                num,
                status,
            ) in ctx.storage._data.items()  # pylint: disable=protected-access
            if isinstance(num, int)
        }

        available_tables = []
        for number, status in tables.items():
            if (
                status.seats >= msg.guests
                and status.time_start <= msg.time_start
                and status.time_end >= msg.time_start + msg.duration
            ):
                available_tables.append(int(number))

        ctx.logger.info(f"Query: {msg}. Available tables: {available_tables}.")

        await ctx.send(sender, QueryTableResponse(tables=available_tables))

        total_queries = int(ctx.storage.get("total_queries") or 0)
        ctx.storage.set("total_queries", total_queries + 1)

    @query_proto.on_query(model=GetTotalQueries, replies=TotalQueries)
    async def handle_get_total_queries(ctx: Context, sender: str, _msg: GetTotalQueries):
        total_queries = int(ctx.storage.get("total_queries") or 0)
        await ctx.send(sender, TotalQueries(total_queries=total_queries))
    ```

#### Table booking protocol

We can now proceed by writing the booking protocol script for booking the table at the restaurant. We first need to import the necessary classes and define the message data models. In this case, the booking protocol consists of two message models: `BookTableRequest` and `BookTableResponse`. Then, we create an instance of the `Protocol` class and name it `book_proto` and give it a version:

    ```py copy
    from uagents import Context, Model, Protocol
    from .query import TableStatus

    class BookTableRequest(Model):
        table_number: int
        time_start: int
        duration: int

    class BookTableResponse(Model):
        success: bool

    book_proto = Protocol(name="RestaurantBookingProtocolExample", version="0.1.0")

    ```

    - `BookTableRequest` represents the request to book a table. It includes attributes: `table_number` to be booked, `time_start`of the booking, and the duration of the booking.
    - `BookTableResponse` contains the response to the table booking request. It includes a boolean attribute success indicating whether the booking was successful or not.

Let's now define the message handler function:

    ```py copy
    @book_proto.on_message(model=BookTableRequest, replies=BookTableResponse)
    async def handle_book_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: BookTableRequest):
        tables = {
            int(num): TableStatus(**status)
            for (
                num,
                status,
            ) in ctx.storage._data.items()  # pylint: disable=protected-access
            if isinstance(num, int)
        }
        table = tables[msg.table_number]

        if (
            table.time_start <= msg.time_start
            and table.time_end >= msg.time_start + msg.duration
        ):
            success = True
            table.time_start = msg.time_start + msg.duration
            ctx.storage.set(msg.table_number, table.dict())
        else:
            success = False

        # send the response
        await ctx.send(sender, BookTableResponse(success=success))
    ```

    The `handle_book_request()` handler first retrieves table statuses from the agent's storage and converts them into a dictionary with integer keys (table numbers) and `TableStatus` values. The `TableStatus` class is imported from the query module. Next, the handler gets the table associated with the requested `table_number` from the tables dictionary. The handler checks if the requested time_start falls within the availability period of the table. If the table is available for the requested booking duration, the handler sets success to `True`, updates the table's `time_start` to reflect the end of the booking, and saves the updated table information in the agent's storage using `ctx.storage.set()`. If the table is not available for the requested booking, the handler sets success to `False`. The handler sends a `BookTableResponse` message back to the sender with the success status of the booking using the `ctx.send()` method.

The overall script should be: 

    ```py copy filename="book.py"
    from uagents import Context, Model, Protocol
    from .query import TableStatus

    class BookTableRequest(Model):
        table_number: int
        time_start: int
        duration: int

    class BookTableResponse(Model):
        success: bool

    book_proto = Protocol(name="RestaurantBookingProtocolExample", version="0.1.0")

    @book_proto.on_message(model=BookTableRequest, replies=BookTableResponse)
    async def handle_book_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: BookTableRequest):
        tables = {
            int(num): TableStatus(**status)
            for (
                num,
                status,
            ) in ctx.storage._data.items()  # pylint: disable=protected-access
            if isinstance(num, int)
        }
        table = tables[msg.table_number]

        if (
            table.time_start <= msg.time_start
            and table.time_end >= msg.time_start + msg.duration
        ):
            success = True
            table.time_start = msg.time_start + msg.duration
            ctx.storage.set(msg.table_number, table.dict())
        else:
            success = False

        # send the response
        await ctx.send(sender, BookTableResponse(success=success))
    ```

#### Restaurant agent

Let's now move forward and create our restaurant agent in a separate file. In this step, we will import the essential classes from the `uagents` library and reintegrate the two protocols (`book_proto` and `query_proto`) we've previously coded:

    ```py copy
    from protocols.book import book_proto
    from protocols.query import TableStatus, query_proto
    from uagents import Agent

    restaurant = Agent(
        name="restaurant",
        port=8001,
        seed="restaurant recovery phrase",
        endpoint={
            "http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit": {},
        },
    )
    ```

Remember that you need to provide the `name`, `port`, `seed` and `endpoint` parameters to correctly set up the agent. Let's build the `restaurant` agent from above protocols and set the table availability information, by also to storing the `TABLES` information in the `restaurant` agent storage:

    ```py copy
    # build the restaurant agent from stock protocols and publish their details
    restaurant.include(query_proto, publish_manifest=True)
    restaurant.include(book_proto, publish_manifest=True)

    TABLES = {
        1: TableStatus(seats=2, time_start=16, time_end=22),
        2: TableStatus(seats=4, time_start=19, time_end=21),
        3: TableStatus(seats=4, time_start=17, time_end=19),
    }

    for number, status in TABLES.items():
        restaurant.storage.set(number, status.dict())

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        restaurant.run()
    ```

The `restaurant` agent is now online and ready to receive messages.

The overall script would be as follow:

    ```py copy filename="restaurant_agent.py"
    from protocols.book import book_proto
    from protocols.query import TableStatus, query_proto
    from uagents import Agent

    restaurant = Agent(
        name="restaurant",
        port=8001,
        seed="restaurant recovery phrase",
        endpoint={
            "http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit": {},
        },
    )

    # build the restaurant agent from stock protocols and publish their details
    restaurant.include(query_proto, publish_manifest=True)
    restaurant.include(book_proto, publish_manifest=True)

    TABLES = {
        1: TableStatus(seats=2, time_start=16, time_end=22),
        2: TableStatus(seats=4, time_start=19, time_end=21),
        3: TableStatus(seats=4, time_start=17, time_end=19),
    }

    for number, status in TABLES.items():
        restaurant.storage.set(number, status.dict())

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        restaurant.run()
    ```

#### User agent

We can now define the script for our `user` agent querying and booking a table at the `restaurant`.

Once we've imported the necessary classes from the `uagents` library and the two protocols we previously defined, we also need the `restaurant` agent's address so for the `user` agent to be able to communicate with it:

    ```py copy
    from protocols.book import BookTableRequest, BookTableResponse
    from protocols.query import (
        QueryTableRequest,
        QueryTableResponse,
    )
    from uagents import Agent, Context

    RESTAURANT_ADDRESS = (
        "test-agent://agent1qfpqn9jhvp9cg33f27q6jvmuv52dgyg9rfuu37rmxrletlqe7lewwjed5gy"
    )

    user = Agent(
        name="user",
        port=8000,
        seed="user recovery phrase",
        endpoint={
            "http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit": {},
        },
    )
    ```

Remember that you need to provide the `RESTAURANT_ADDRESS`, `name`, `port`, `seed` and `endpoint` parameters to correctly set up the agent and code. Let's then create the table query to generate the `QueryTableRequest` using the `restaurant` address. Then, we need to create an `on_interval()` function which periodically queries the `restaurant`, asking for the availability of a table given the `table_query` parameters:

    ```py copy
    table_query = QueryTableRequest(
        guests=3,
        time_start=19,
        duration=2,
    )

    @user.on_interval(period=3.0, messages=QueryTableRequest)
    async def interval(ctx: Context):
        completed = ctx.storage.get("completed")

        if not completed:
            await ctx.send(RESTAURANT_ADDRESS, table_query)
    ```

We then need to define the message handler function for incoming `QueryTableResponse` messages from the `restaurant` agent:

    ```py copy
    @user.on_message(QueryTableResponse, replies={BookTableRequest})
    async def handle_query_response(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: QueryTableResponse):
        if len(msg.tables) > 0:
            ctx.logger.info("There is a free table, attempting to book one now")
            table_number = msg.tables[0]
            request = BookTableRequest(
                table_number=table_number,
                time_start=table_query.time_start,
                duration=table_query.duration,
            )
            await ctx.send(sender, request)
        else:
            ctx.logger.info("No free tables - nothing more to do")
            ctx.storage.set("completed", True)
    ```

Let's then define a function which will handle messages from the `restaurant` agent on whether the reservation was successful or not:

    ```py copy
    @user.on_message(BookTableResponse, replies=set())
    async def handle_book_response(ctx: Context, _sender: str, msg: BookTableResponse):
        if msg.success:
            ctx.logger.info("Table reservation was successful")
        else:
            ctx.logger.info("Table reservation was UNSUCCESSFUL")

        ctx.storage.set("completed", True)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        user.run()
    ```

The overall script would be:

    ```py copy filename="user_agent.py"
    from protocols.book import BookTableRequest, BookTableResponse
    from protocols.query import (
        QueryTableRequest,
        QueryTableResponse,
    )
    from uagents import Agent, Context

    RESTAURANT_ADDRESS = (
        "test-agent://agent1qfpqn9jhvp9cg33f27q6jvmuv52dgyg9rfuu37rmxrletlqe7lewwjed5gy"
    )

    user = Agent(
        name="user",
        port=8000,
        seed="user recovery phrase",
        endpoint={
            "http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit": {},
        },
    )

    table_query = QueryTableRequest(
        guests=3,
        time_start=19,
        duration=2,
    )

    @user.on_interval(period=3.0, messages=QueryTableRequest)
    async def interval(ctx: Context):
        completed = ctx.storage.get("completed")

        if not completed:
            await ctx.send(RESTAURANT_ADDRESS, table_query)


    @user.on_message(QueryTableResponse, replies={BookTableRequest})
    async def handle_query_response(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: QueryTableResponse):
        if len(msg.tables) > 0:
            ctx.logger.info("There is a free table, attempting to book one now")
            table_number = msg.tables[0]
            request = BookTableRequest(
                table_number=table_number,
                time_start=table_query.time_start,
                duration=table_query.duration,
            )
            await ctx.send(sender, request)
        else:
            ctx.logger.info("No free tables - nothing more to do")
            ctx.storage.set("completed", True)


    @user.on_message(BookTableResponse, replies=set())
    async def handle_book_response(ctx: Context, _sender: str, msg: BookTableResponse):
        if msg.success:
            ctx.logger.info("Table reservation was successful")
        else:
            ctx.logger.info("Table reservation was UNSUCCESSFUL")

        ctx.storage.set("completed", True)


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        user.run()
    ```

We are ready to run the example.

Run the `restaurant` agent and then the `user` agent from different terminals. The output should be as follows:

    **Restaurant**:

        ```
        [restaurant]: Query: guests=3 time_start=19 duration=2. Available tables: [2].
        ```

    **User**:

        ```
        [ user]: There is a free table, attempting to book one now
        [ user]: Table reservation was successful
        ```
