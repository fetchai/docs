# Agents 101, for AI-Engine 🤖

## Overview

Welcome to **Agents 101**! This course is designed to introduce you to the overall system of Fetch.ai, and show how to
build agents to be accessible to the AI-Engine, and integrate with other projects. This course is a parallel track to
[Agents 101](/guides/agent-courses/introductory-course).

At any stage, if you encounter uncertainties or have questions about specific terms or topics throughout the course, our support team is (almost always) available on [Discord ↗️](https://discord.gg/fetchai) to assist you.


## fetch.ai..

Fetch.ai is developing a platform to help the development of an AI enabled decentralized digital economy. Agents are
programs that can make choices on their own for individuals, companies, and devices. Agents are the actors, and the
heart of Fetch.ai ecosystem.

For us, our key need to know terms are: Agents, Agentverse, AI Engine, and DeltaV.

## What is an agent, agentverse, ai-engine and deltav 😱!

Let's try and keep this really simple 🎉

 - agents - agents are programs that work as you instruct them, classicaly this would have been part of a multi agent system whereby agents have a task and communicate with other agents. In this vertical, agents are part of a multiagent system, but their primary use is to represent a service, function or data which can be accessed by deltaV.

 -  agentverse - agentverse is a managed hosting platform and entrypoint to AI-Engine for agents. You would register your agents on agentverse to be a service in the network.

 - AI-engine - The AI Engine is a system that combines Agents️ with human-readable text input to create a scalable AI infrastructure that supports Large Language Models (LLMs). Really, all this means is an AI system can convert human text into actionable (computer) commands.

 - deltaV - deltav is an assistive chat interface to allow human input to interact with agents registered with deltaV.

alert! Agents are programs, services are the functions your agents offer.

At the core of it all, AI-Engine indexes agents, and translates human input into tasks. This is a bit like a search
engine, but does more.

 ![AI Engine has an internal database hat creates understanding and links to existing services](../../../src/images/guides/101/ai-connects.jpg)

AI-Engine allows for a term we call chaining, chaining is the idea that if you were to ask "Tell me about the animal
Zebra" AI Engine would look for an agent that could give a summary, another agent could provide the information
about a zebra. AI Engine understands that the Summary Agent requires text to parse and summarise, so AI Engine would
contact Zebra Agent and get the information from Zebra Agent. With that information, AI Engine would call the Summary
Agent with the Zebra Agent information so that the Summary agent will return the summarised text.

It kinda works like this:

![](../../../src/images/guides/101/chaining.jpg)

What's happening here, is that when AI-Engine selects a response, the subtasks available to be called for that task
are already known to it.

Of course this could be more complicated, what if every sensor on a car was an agent, you could ask you car for
diagnostics on a system, and each component in that system could independently give their status. AI Engine
understands the schema of each Agent, so there would be little need for each component to be compatible in
communication with eachother.

## Okay, so how does this all work?

Okay, bear with me. Some new terms.

![](../../../src/images/guides/system.svg)

Two separate processes are happening. The first part of the sequence diagram registers two agents:

 1. Firstly agents register to a smart contract, effectively paying to be discoverable.
 2. Agents then regsiter as a service on Agentverse (you'd usually do this by hand)

Great, agents are registered and discoverable.

The seoncd part of the diagram introuces the flow of AI-Engine. This shows the role of a user who has entered a
search term into deltaV.

1. Qustion comes in, and is sent to AI-Engine.
2.  AI-Engine has an internal loop that updates services registered and indexed.
3.  AI-Engine has another internal loop that is creating embeddings of these services.
4. Upon receiving text,  AI-Engine understands and maps the text to Services.
5.  AI-Engine requests addresses from Almanac to message these agnts.
6.  AI-Engine sees that Agent (A) needs some text as part of it's servicse.
7. AI Engine finds sub tasks which can provide the required data.
8. Contacts sub task, and required data is returned.
9. Data is passed to Agent (A) which returns summary of the data.
10. repsonse returned to user on DeltaV.

** tasks and subtasks are agent functions. In the context of Ai-Engine they're (sub)tasks, but you're developing
agents.


## Okay, let's build a couple of agents

We've got a high level idea of how this works, let's build this on agentverse so that we can get this running on
deltaV and see the whole stack connected.

If you've never installed anything for uAgent development, follow these instructions [setup the development environment](guides/agents/installing-uagent#development-tools) then this guide [to install uAgents locally](guides/agents/installing-uagent#install-with-pip)



## Create your first agent, the html summariser

We're going to run our agents locally, and set up a mailbox on agentverse. Our first agent takes some HTML and
summarises the contents with Langchain and OpenAI.

We need to create a Python file for this example. We can do this by running: `touch html_summary_agent.py`


    ```py copy
    from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain
    from langchain_community.document_loaders import UnstructuredHTMLLoader
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Protocol, Model
    from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType
    import os


    class HTML(Model):
        text: str

    SEED_PHRASE = "let us summarise v2"
    AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY = "AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY"
    OPENAI_API_KEY = "OPENAI_API_KEY"

    summaryAgent = Agent(
        name="SummaryAgent",
        seed=SEED_PHRASE,
        mailbox=f"{AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY}@https://agentverse.ai",
    )

    summary_protocol = Protocol("Text Summariser")

    print(summaryAgent.address)
    print(OPENAI_API_KEY)


    @summary_protocol.on_message(model=HTML, replies={UAgentResponse})
    async def summarise(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: HTML):
        with open("./temp.html", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            f.write(msg.text)

        # Step 1: Initialize WebBaseLoader with the given URL
        loader = UnstructuredHTMLLoader("./temp.html")

        # Step 2: Load the document
        docs = loader.load()

        # Step 3: Load summarization chain
        llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY, temperature=0, model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106")
        chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type="stuff")

        # Step 4: Run the summarization chain on the loaded document
        summarized_content = chain.invoke(docs)
        summarized = summarized_content["input_documents"][0].to_json()

        # Step 5: Define the needed dependencies
        dependencies = {
            "langchain": ">=1.0.0",
            "langchain_community": ">=1.0.0",
            "langchain_openai": ">=1.0.0"
        }

        result = chain.invoke(docs)

        await ctx.send(
            sender,
            UAgentResponse(message=(result["output_text"]), type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL),
        )


    summaryAgent.include(summary_protocol, publish_manifest=True)
    summaryAgent.run()

    ```

Okay, we've got the whole code block above us. We're going to assume you know about python imports, if you don't
[look here](). There's a lot of really cool, neat things you need to know...

    ```py copy
    class HTML(Model):
            text: str

        SEED_PHRASE = "SEED_PHRASE"
        AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY = "AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY"
        OPENAI_API_KEY = "OPENAI_API_KEY"

        summaryAgent = Agent(
            name="SummaryAgent",
            seed=SEED_PHRASE,
            mailbox=f"{AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY}@https://agentverse.ai",
        )

        summary_protocol = Protocol("Text Summariser")
    ```

The `class HTML` defines the structure of the message the agent expects to receive. In this case, each message
should have `.text` var.

`SEED_PHRASE` is our agents unique seed. `AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY` mailbox key is our id of our mailbox hosted on
agentverse. `OPENAI_API_KEY` is our api key to open ai's api.

Then we initialise the agent, and define the protocol. To read more about the Agent object please checkout [the
reference docs](../../references/uagents/uagents-api/agent#agent-objects)


Then we have our on_message handler.
    ```py copy

        @summary_protocol.on_message(model=HTML, replies={UAgentResponse})
        async def summarise(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: HTML):

        ... langchain stuff ...
        result = chain.invoke(docs)

        await ctx.send(
            sender,
            UAgentResponse(message=(result["output_text"]), type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL),
        )


        summaryAgent.include(summary_protocol, publish_manifest=True)
        summaryAgent.run()
    ```

 We  need a way for our agent to receive messages. We do this by creating a function for our agent to handle all
 incoming messages from other agents. We use `on_message()` decorator that activates the summarise() function once
 our agent receives a message matching the Message HTML model we previously defined.

We finally run the agent at the bottom of the script:

    ```py

        summaryAgent.include(summary_protocol, publish_manifest=True)
        summaryAgent.run()
    ```

Including protocol into the agent effectively allows other agents to know how this agent expects communication.

You can run this with `poetry run python html_summary_agent.py`.

You'll see something like `agent1qtc5m8xudkm6gjv98k3kxl3ydzhkhzsfx6pgla0mzlgsawlqkzkvcjh5en2` in the terminal. Let's
use this to create a mailbox.

### Creating a mailbox for summary agent...

Let's go to [agentverse.ai](https://agentverse.ai/mailroom) and create a mailbox.

Add a name:

![](../../../src/images/guides/101/create_mailbox.png)

Let's paste in your agents address that we printed to screen:

![](../../../src/images/guides/101/create_mailbox_address.png)

Then, let's copy our new mailbox API key.

![](../../../src/images/guides/101/create_mailbox_get_key.png)



Update the `AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY = "AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY"` inline. Now you can restart your agent and it will be
registered to the mailbox. Your terminal output will looking simialr to:

```
Poetry run python summary.py
agent1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX4
INFO:     [SummaryAgent]: Manifest published successfully: Text Summariser
INFO:     [SummaryAgent]: Almanac registration is up to date!
INFO:     [SummaryAgent]: Connecting to mailbox server at agentverse.ai
INFO:     [SummaryAgent]: Mailbox access token acquired
```

Okay, take a quick break then let's create the second agent ☕.

## Create the HTML downloading agent.

The next agent in the chain is the HTML downloading agent. This one has the same structure as the summary agent.

Let's take a look.

    ```py copy
        from uagents import Agent, Context, Protocol, Model
        from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType
        import requests

        class Text(Model):
            url: str

        SEED_PHRASE = "harvesting your sunshine forever okah"
        AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY = "2006010d-24ec-4874-b83a-eb992b64946a"
        textAgent = Agent(
            name="aloha",
            seed=SEED_PHRASE,
            mailbox=f"{AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY}@https://agentverse.ai",
        )

        content_protocol = Protocol("Web page content getter")

        print(textAgent.address)

        def get_webpage(url):
            r = requests.get(url)
            return r.text

        @content_protocol.on_message(model=Text, replies={UAgentResponse})
        async def page_content(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Text):
            message = get_webpage(msg.url)
            await ctx.send(
                sender, UAgentResponse(message=message, type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL)
            )

        textAgent.include(content_protocol, publish_manifest=True)
        textAgent.run()
    ```

This agent is simple again, hopefully you're seeing a pattern here. These agents are part of a chain, a chain of
two. They're agents that really are functions, each agent on message returns an explicit response. _See [Agents
communicating]() to see how agents work without the AI-Engine._ The key difference in web_download_agent.py is that
this agent calls another function, the logic itself is different in that the purpose is to call a webpage and return
it's content; and of course the Model is different.

Let's run this one too, again follow the steps for the previous agent and go and register a mailbox and update this
agent with the new mailbox. Each agent much have a unique mailbox.



## Let's go create some services; err, what's a service?

A service is ...

You create one by...

This is the service for the SummaryAgent.
