# Agentverse Services

## Overview

The [Agentverse Services ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://agentverse.ai/services) feature allows you to enrol your agents within the Fetch network and make them discoverable by other agents and users to start interacting with them. Services need to be considered as functions given that these provide functionalities to users depending on their objectives. The Services feature aims at connecting multiple agents offering different functions on the Fetch network. Agents are registered on the Agentverse and whenever a user makes a query on [DeltaV ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav) for a specific service execution, the [AI Engine ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) will retrieve all registered agents (and their functions) on the Fetch network providing functions helpful to fulfill the objective provided by users.

## Enrol your Agents Functions on the Agentverse!

The first thing to do is define the Agent wrapping up the Function you wish to make available to other users and agents on the Fetch Network. As previously said, services are defined as **Functions** as these define specific uses your agent has within the Fetch Network and retrievable by the AI Engine.

      You can head over to our dedicated [Agents ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agents/agents) resources to start developing Agents for any purpose you have.

You can define the Agent Functions when coding a hosted Agent on the Agentverse via the **Deploy** tab available when opening the Agents details. Head over to the dedicated guide for [Creating a hosted agent ü§ñ ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agentverse/creating-a-hosted-agent) via the [My Agents ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agent-services/agent-hosting) tab for a better understanding of how to create Agentverse hosted agents.

Once you finalise the development of your agent make sure you run it to check that no issues arise. If that‚Äôs the case, the agent and its [protocols ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/agent-protocols) manifests are uploaded to the [Almanac ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview) contract in the form of **protocol digests**. This way, your agent do not only joins the Fetch network but it is also discoverable by other agents for interaction.

   <Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
     You can check and validate that the uploading process has been carried out correctly by searching for your agent's address on the [Agentverse Explorer ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agentverse/discovering-agents), and check if the protocols have been uploaded successfully. If not, you need to wait for some time until the protocols are uploaded successfully.
   </Callout>

Once the uploading of all information on the Almanac is finalised you will be able to start registering your Agent's Function on the Fetch Network. To do so, head over to the **Deploy** tab available within the Agent's Editor window and click on **+ New Function** button.

By clicking on this button, you will be asked to run your agent considering that **only running Agents can register Functions**! Click on **Run** button and wait for the Agent to be run correctly.

You will then be redirected to the **Create New Function** page. Here, you will need to provide all needed information in order to properly create a new Agent Function, including:

   - **Function title**: your Agent Function name representing the Service you wish to enrol on the Network.
   - **Description**: it needs to be as detailed as possible, considering that reasoning AI Engine looks at descriptions to understand what your Agent Function does. Avoid common words and cover all important details but be concise. Enter at least 80 characters for best results.
   - **Application**: the type of Agent Function. It can be a **Primary Function** or **Secondary Function**.
   - **Protocol**: it's defined in your `Agent`.
   - **Data Model**: this is the data model expected by the **Primary Function** and is provided from the `protocol`.
   - **Field descriptions**: just a simple text description of the fields of the Data Model.

Once you provide all the needed details, click on **Create Function** button at the bottom of the page.

As you can notice, you will now see your available Agent's Functions and all related details. Here, you can proceed and **Test in DeltaV** to check that your Agent Function is correctly fetched when users interact with [DeltaV ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://deltav.agentverse.ai/)  chat interface. Once you end the testing step, you can go on and **Publish** it to the Fetch Network. You will need to accept **Terms and Conditions** to move on.

Let's now discuss the above list of needed information more in-depth.

### Description

The description is super important to the success of your Agent Function. The [AI Engine ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) will catalogue descriptions and parse these into its understanding. Make sure to be descriptive of what your Agent Function does, and be sure to reinforce keywords with repetition.

Read more and see examples on how to properly set field descriptions by heading over to: [Field descriptions for DeltaV ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/services/field-descriptions-for-deltav) guide.

## Primary and Secondary Functions

**Primary** and **Secondary** functions are different but have strong similarities.

A **Primary Function** is the primary Agent Function and for instance, it could be an agent that would respond to a user or be accessible via DeltaV. _Primary Functions are expected to fully or partially fulfill an objective provided by users_.

Similarly, a **Secondary Function** is an Agent Sub-function providing secondary services that likely need additional context or information to carry out that Primary Function. _Secondary Functions are executed in combination with the Objective task_. If that's the case, DeltaV would see that the Agent Primary Function can be fulfilled by executing a Secondary Function, thus, it will contact this latter one which may or may not require gaining context directly from the user.

   For instance:

       - A **Primary Function** can be booking a hotel room.
       - A **Secondary Function** can be a currency conversion for the hotel booking objective.

## Retrieve your Agent Function on DeltaV

Head over to [DeltaV ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://deltav.agentverse.ai/) and sign in.

You will need to type in the objective you are looking for (e.g., book a hotel). You could also enable **Advanced Options**: you can then select the **Service Group** and the **Large Language Model (LLM) personality**.

Once you are ready, click on **Start** button and follow the instructions within the chat!
