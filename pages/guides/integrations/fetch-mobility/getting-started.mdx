# Getting started üéØ

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need the following:

- [Python ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8+.
- [Poetry ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://python-poetry.org/).
- [uAgents framework ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/).

## Set up the project and virtual environment

First of all, create a `mobility-integrations` folder for your project files: `mkdir mobility-integrations`. Then, create another `src` sub-folder within it for your scripts: `mkdir src`.

To run the example, you will need **API keys** from:

1. **OPENCHARGEMAP API KEY**

   - Visit the [OpenChargeMap API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://openchargemap.org/site/develop/api).
   - If you don't have an account, create one by signing up.
   - Once you are logged in, click on the MY PROFILE > my apps at the top.
   - Click on REGISTER AN APPLICATION button.
   - Fill out the required information in the form, including the purpose of using the API, and submit the request.
   - Once approved, you will see your `OPENCHARGEMAP_API_KEY` under MY API KEYS.

2. **GEOAPI API KEY üó∫Ô∏è**
   - Go to the [Geoapify ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://www.geoapify.com/).
   - Sign in to your Google account or create a new one if you don't have an existing account.
   - Once you are logged in, create a new project by clicking on the "Add a new project" button under the Projects section.
   - Give your project a name and click "OK" to create the new project.
   - Your `GEOAPI_API_KEY` will be generated. Copy this key and keep it secure, as it will be used to access Geoapify Projects and other services.

Once you retrieve the information above, create a `.env` file in the `mobility-integrations` directory and export the obtained API keys as environment variables:

```
export OPENCHARGEMAP_API_KEY="{GET THE API KEY}"
export GEOAPI_API_KEY="{GET THE API KEY}"
```

To use the environment variables from `.env` file and install the project dependencies:

```
source .env
poetry install
```

We can now start defining our agents and messages data model.
