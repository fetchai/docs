# uAgents Mobility Integrations ðŸš—ðŸ”Œ

Mobility solutions are essential and pivotal in today's fast-paced world. To simplify and enhance the integration of mobility services, we present the uAgents Mobility Integrations guide. This one offers a practical example featuring two key agents: **ev_charger** and **geoapi_car_parking** agents.

The **ev_charger** agent empowers users to find available EV chargers in a specific region within a given radius. Leveraging the OpenChargeMap API, it provides real-time access to vital charging information. Whether you are planning a cross-country electric vehicle journey or simply seeking a charging point in your neighborhood, this agent has you covered.

On the other hand, the **geoapi_car_parking** agent addresses the challenge of parking space availability. By inputting latitude, longitude, and a radius, users can effortlessly locate nearby parking spaces. This agent taps into Geoapify's resources, ensuring accurate and up-to-date parking information for your convenience.

Getting started with these agents is straightforward. By following a few simple steps, you can access the data you need to make informed mobility decisions. From obtaining API keys to setting up the environment and running the project, our guide walks you through the process, enabling you to integrate these agents into your mobility solutions straightforwardly.

In this guide, we'll take you through each step, ensuring you have the tools and knowledge necessary to harness the power of these agents. So, whether you're a developer creating innovative mobility apps or an individual looking for the nearest charging station or parking spot, join us on this journey to unlock a world of mobility possibilities.
