# AI Agents holiday integrations ‚úàÔ∏è

## Introduction üöÄ

The AI Agents Holiday Integrations example demonstrates how to integrate and coordinate multiple agents to provide information and support in the handling and booking of flights, travels, and activities so to assist you in organizing your perfect holiday in a matter of few minutes.

The example showcases how different agents can work together and how these interact with various APIs to gather and process data to help you in booking the perfect holiday according to your needs and wishes!

## Getting started üéØ

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need the following:

    - [Python ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8+.
    - [Poetry ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://python-poetry.org/).
    - [uAgents Framework ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/installing-uagent).

### Set up the project and virtual environment

Using a terminal navigate to a directory where you're happy to work within then create a `fetch-holiday` folder for your project files: `mkdir fetch-holiday`. Then, create another `src` sub-folder within it for your scripts: `mkdir src`.

To run the example, you will need **API keys** from:

    1. **RapidAPI Key**

       - Visit [RapidAPI ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://rapidapi.com/hub) and sign up or log in.
       - Search for the Skyscanner API and subscribe.
       - Once subscribed, copy your _X-RapidAPI-Key_.

    2. **OpenAI API Key**

       - Visit [OpenAI ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://openai.com/).
       - Sign up or log in.
       - Navigate to the API section to obtain your API key.

        <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
          Note that if you have run out of OpenAI credits, you will not be able to get results for this example.
        </Callout>

    3. **SerpAPI Key**

       - Visit [SerpAPI ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://serpapi.com/) and sign up or log in.
       - Your API key will be available on the dashboard.

Once you have all three keys, create a `.env` file within the `src` folder in your project: `touch src/.env`

Update to including the following:

    ```
    export RAPIDAPI_API_KEY="{GET THE API KEY}"
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="{GET THE API KEY}"
    export SERPAPI_API_KEY="{GET THE API KEY}"
    ```

To use the environment variables from `.env` and install the project:

    ```
    cd src
    source .env
    poetry intall
    ```
