# Getting started üéØ
## Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need the following:

- [Python ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8+.
- [Poetry ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://python-poetry.org/).
- [ŒºAgents framework ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/).

## Set up the project and virtual environment

First of all, create a `fetch-holiday` folder for your project files: `mkdir fetch-holiday`. Then, create another `src` sub-folder within it for your scripts: `mkdir src`.

To run the example, you will need **API keys** from:

1. **RapidAPI Key**
    - Visit [RapidAPI ‚Üó](https://rapidapi.com/hub) and sign up or log in.
    - Search for the Skyscanner API and subscribe.
    - Once subscribed, copy your _X-RapidAPI-Key_.

2. **OpenAI API Key**
    - Visit [OpenAI ‚Üó](https://openai.com/).
    - Sign up or log in.
    - Navigate to the API section to obtain your API key.

    _Note that if you have run out of OpenAI credits, you will not be able to get results for this example.__

3. **SerpAPI Key**
    - Visit [SerpAPI ‚Üó](https://serpapi.com/) and sign up or log in.
    - Your API key will be available on the dashboard.

Once you have all three keys, create a `.env` file within the `src` folder in your project, including the following:

```py
export RAPIDAPI_API_KEY="{GET THE API KEY}"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="{GET THE API KEY}"
export SERPAPI_API_KEY="{GET THE API KEY}"
```

To use the environment variables from `.env` and install the project:

```py
cd src
source .env
poetry intall
```
