# AI-Engine Javascript SDk

## Introduction

AI Engine SDK provides an easy-to-use interface for integrating advanced AI functionalities into your applications. With a simple API and comprehensive documentation, developers can effortlessly leverage powerful AI tools and enhance their projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Node.js v20 or higher** is installed on your system.
- A valid **Agentverse API key**. You can obtain this from [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
To find out how to generate an API KEY, check out the documentation regarding [Agentverse API keys ↗️](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/apis/agent-function-creation-apis).
</Callout>

### Installation
You can install the AI Engine SDK using npm or yarn. Follow the commands below.

```bash copy
npm install @fetchai/ai-engine-sdk
yarn add @fetchai/ai-engine-sdk
```

## SDK overview

### Creating the AI Engine client object

To set up and initialize the AI Engine client with your API key, use the following code snippet. This client will allow you to interact with the AI Engine API, enabling you to start sessions, get function groups, and manage messages.

```javascript copy
import { AiEngine } from "@fetchai/ai-engine-sdk";
const aiEngine = new AiEngine(apiKey);
```

### Querying Function Groups in AI Engine SDK

```javascript copy
const functionGroups = await aiEngine.getFunctionGroups();
const functionGroupId = functionGroups.find((g) => g.name === "Fetch Verified");
```

If you would like to use the functions in your own My Functions function group, you can use this filter instead:

```javascript copy
const functionGroupId = functionGroups.find((g) => g.name === "My Functions");
```

### Creating a session with the AI Engine

This code starts a session with the AI Engine using the UUID of the selected function group.

```javascript copy
const session = await aiEngine.createSession(functionGroupId);
```

### Starting the conversation with an arbitrary objective

```javascript copy
await session.start("Find a holiday destination");
```

### Querying new messages

This line asynchronously queries the AI engine to retrieve a list of messages related to the current session. Use `setTimeout` or `setInterval` to regularly check for new messages.

```javascript copy
const messages = await session.getMessages();
```

## Handling Different Types of Messages

#### Task Selection Message (`isTaskSelectionMessage`)

This message is generated when the AI engine suggests functions based on the initial objective or provides multiple options for a function.

#### Agent Message (`isAgentMessage`)

This is a regular question from the AI Engine that the user needs to reply to with a string.

#### AI Engine Message (`isAiEngineMessage`)

This message type doesn't require a user response; it simply notifies the user about something.

#### Confirmation Message (`isConfirmationMessage`)

This message is sent when the AI Engine has gathered all necessary inputs for the agent's function, indicating that the context is complete.

#### Stop Message (`isStopMessage`)

This message is sent when the session has ended, and the AI Engine no longer expects any replies from the user.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
All message types (except for the AI engine message and stop message) expect a response from the user.
</Callout>

## SDK Methods for Replying

### Task Selection Message

Use `session.submitTaskSelection`.

### Agent Message

Use `session.submitResponse`.

### Confirmation Message

Use either `session.submitConfirmation` to confirm, or `session.rejectConfirmation` to reject the context generated by the AI engine.

## Deleting session

After finishing a conversation with the AI Engine, you can delete the session by using the following command.

```javascript copy
 await session.delete()
```

## Example Usage of the SDK

The following example demonstrates how to use the AI Engine SDK to interact with the AI Engine. The script sets up the client, queries function groups, creates a session, and handles different types of messages in a loop.
