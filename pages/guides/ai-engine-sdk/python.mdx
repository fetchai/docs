# AI-Engine Python SDk

## Introduction

AI Engine SDK provides an easy-to-use interface for integrating advanced AI functionalities into your applications. With a simple API and comprehensive documentation, developers can effortlessly leverage powerful AI tools and enhance their projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Python 3.10 or higher** installed on your system.
- A valid **Agentverse API key**. You can obtain this from [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
To find out how to generate an API KEY check out the documentation regarding [Agentverse API keys ↗️](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/apis/agent-function-creation-apis).
</Callout>

### Installation
You can install the AI Engine SDK using either Poetry or pip. Follow the commands below.

```bash copy
poetry add ai-engine-sdk
pip install ai-engine-sdk
```

## SDK overview

### Creating the AI Engine client object

To set up and initialize the AI Engine client with your API key, use the following code snippet. This client will allow you to interact with the AI Engine API, enabling you to start sessions, get function groups, and manage messages.

```py copy
from ai_engine_sdk import AiEngine
ai_engine: AiEngine = AiEngine(api_key)
```

## Querying Function Groups

The AI Engine SDK allows you to query different groups of functions, such as `private functions`, `public functions`, or `Fetch.ai-verified functions`. You can filter function groups using the respective methods provided by the SDK based on your needs.

### Querying Private Functions

Private functions are those that you have created and are not accessible to the public or other users. To access your private functions, use the `get_private_function_groups()` method. This will return all functions under your account, giving you access to personal or proprietary models and algorithms.

#### Example

```python
private = await ai_engine.get_private_function_groups()

private_functions = next(
    (g for g in private if g.name == "My Functions"), 
    None
)
```

#### Querying Public Functions

Public functions are accessible by anyone on the platform. These functions include your publicly available functions and functions verified by Fetch.ai. To access public function groups, use the `get_public_function_groups()` method. You can further filter by two important groups: `Public` and `Fetch Verified`.

```py copy
public = await ai_engine.get_public_function_groups()

# Access your public functions
public_functions = next(
    (g for g in public if g.name == "Public"), 
    None
)

# Access Fetch.ai-verified functions
fetch_verified_group = next(
    (g for g in public if g.name == "Fetch Verified"), 
    None
)
```

### Sharing function groups

Allow other users to use functions, under a function-group, without replicating that function or allowing
them alter those functions or function-group data.

If you wish to give access to a certain function-group (use, not alter the data/state of it), you can use the following method in the following way:

```python
# assuming `ai_engine` is a valid instance of AiEngine

what_function_group_identifier_i_want_share="normally-this-is-an-uuid4"
user_email_i_want_to_share_the_function_group_with = "random@domain.com"
await ai_engine.share_function_group(
	function_group_id=what_function_group_identifier_i_want_share,
	target_user_email=user_email_i_want_to_share_the_function_group_with
)
```
Now, if you were requesting the available function-groups for the user with email assigned to the `target_user_email` argument, the function-group with the id assigned to `function_group_id`.

You can check that by using the `AiEngine.get_function_groups` method.

### Creating a session with the AI Engine.

This code starts a session with the AI Engine using the UUID of the selected function group.

```py copy
session = await ai_engine.create_session(function_group=public_group.uuid)
```

### Starting the conversation with an arbitrary objective

```py copy
await session.start(objective)
```

### Querying new messages

This line asynchronously queries the AI engine to retrieve a list of messages related to the current session. The messages are returned as a list of `ApiBaseMessage` objects, which can include various types of messages such as agent messages, AI engine messages, task selections, confirmations, and session stop messages. These messages are then processed to determine the next actions in the session workflow.

```py copy
while True:
	messages: list[ApiBaseMessage] = await session.get_messages()
	sleep(4)
```

## Handling Different Types of Messages

#### Task Selection Message (`is_task_selection_message`)

This message is generated when the AI engine suggests functions based on the initial objective or provides multiple options for a function.

#### Agent Message (`is_agent_message`)

This is a regular question from the AI Engine that the user needs to reply to with a string.

#### AI Engine Message (`is_ai_engine_message`)

This message type doesn't require a user response; it simply notifies the user about something.

#### Confirmation Message (`is_confirmation_message`)

This message is sent when the AI Engine has gathered all necessary inputs for the agent's function, indicating that the context is complete.

#### Stop Message (`is_stop_message`)

This message is sent when the session has ended, and the AI Engine no longer expects any replies from the user.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
All message types (expect for the AI engine message and stop message) expects a response from the user.
</Callout>

## SDK Methods for Replying

### Task Selection Message

Use `session.submit_task_selection`.

### Agent Message

Use `session.submit_response`.

### Confirmation Message

Use either `session.submit_confirmation` to confirm, or `session.reject_confirmation` to reject the context generated by the AI engine.

## Deleting session

After finishing a conversation with the AI Engine, you can delete the session by using the following command.

```py copy
 await session.delete()
```

## Example Usage of the SDK

The following example demonstrates how to use the AI Engine SDK to interact with the AI Engine. The script sets up the client, queries function groups, creates a session, and handles different types of messages in a loop.
