# Agent Functions

Agents can act as executable functions for the AI Engine. We can enable this by utilizing Agentverse and registering
our Agent's function on the platform. The AI Engine then indexes the registered function and can then communicate with
your Agent. Checkout the [Agents 101 for AI Engine ↗️](/guides/agent-courses/agents-for-ai#agent-agentverse-ai-engine-and-deltav) for a wider explanation of how this works.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Check out the [AI Engine package ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents-ai-engine/) to download it and start integrating your Agents with this tool!

      Current version of the package is <PackageVersion packageName="uagents-ai-engine" packageType="pypi" />.

## Local Agent Function registration

Sometimes you'll want to run an Agent on your own hardware or infrastructure; luckily this is very easy to do on any system that support **Python 3.10**.

### Overview

This system is pretty simple and makes you get started as quickly as possible. You can run this Agent on any device you'd like; in this scenario we're running on a VM, but you could run this on your laptop, raspberry pi or tweak for [Agentverse ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro). 

On startup our script will register our Agent to the [Almanac ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/almanac), and then our Agent will be available to communicate with other Agents. To get this Agent to be [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav) accessible,  we will also go to Agentverse to create a new Function for the Agent, to then allow this Agent to be found in DeltaV.

It is important that you provide the `name`, `port`, `seed` and `endpoint` for your Agent to correctly run this code.

A few things to note; you'll need to be running this Agent on infrastructure that allows you to open a port, in our example we run on port `6145`. The agent is initialized with an `endpoint`, and a `port` - this is so that we can receive messages, and other Agents know where to send them. On the Testnet, you can use the `fund_agent_if_low` to get some funds, if you need them to register your Agent to the Almanac. We then define the protocol, which is just an `int` as seen in the `Request` object.

The `on_message` doesn't do much other than return a number between 1 and the defined `dice_sides` from the message inclusive. However, the response type is of  `UAgentResponse` which is essential to communicate with DeltaV.

`.run()` initializes the Agent.

Finally, we run our Agent as follows: `python simple_function.py`

### Register a local Agent Function on the Agentverse

For this example we set up a really simple Agent Function. For further information on Agent Functions and registration process, see [Register Agent Functions on the Agentverse ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services) resource.

To register **Local Agents and Functions**, you will first need to head over to the [local Agent Inspector ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/local-agent-inspector) available by clicking on the dedicated link presented within your terminal output after running the above local Agent. Once you do so, click on **Connect** button and select **Mailbox**. Follow the steps closely and provide all needed data required.

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse-mailbox/mailbox_1a.png)

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse-mailbox/mailbox_2a.png)

After this, click **Connect**. 

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse-mailbox/mailbox_3a.png)

At this point, you do not need to do anything else. Click **Finish**. 

 ![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse-mailbox/mailbox_4a.png)

Once your agent is connected via the Mailbox correctly, you will see a box depicting it within the **My Agents** tab.

![](src/images/guides/uagent/servicefordungeons_1.png)

Click on it and head over to the **Deploy** tab and click on **+ New Function**. 

![](src/images/guides/uagent/servicefordungeons_2.png)

Here, you can now provide the needed details for your Agent Function in the dedicated fields. Remember to provide detailed descriptions for what your **Agent Function** does and the **Fields** for data Models expected. understanding of Functions fields descriptions.

![](src/images/guides/uagent/servicefordungeons_3.png)

It's recommended you alter the contract slightly, and follow the above steps so that you can run an Agent, create a function for the Agent and then have that Agent accessible by DeltaV.

## Description of your Agent Function

The **Description** is super important to the success of your Agent Function. The [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) will catalogue descriptions and parse these into its understanding. Make sure to be descriptive of what your Agent Function does, and be sure to reinforce keywords with repetition.

Read more and see examples on how to properly set field descriptions by heading over to: [Field descriptions for DeltaV ↗️](/guides/services/field-descriptions-for-deltav) guide.

## Primary and Secondary Functions

**Primary** and **Secondary** functions are different but have strong similarities. 

The first one is the primary Agent Function and for instance, it could be an agent that would respond to a user or be accessible via DeltaV. _Primary Functions are expected to fully or partially fulfill an objective provided by users_.

Similarly, a **Secondary** function is an Agent Sub-function providing secondary functionalities that likely need additional context or information to carry out the Primary Function. _Secondary Functions are executed in combination with the Objective task_. If that's the case, DeltaV would see that the Agent Primary Function can be fulfilled by executing a Secondary Function, thus, it will contact this latter one which may or may not require gaining context directly from the user.
