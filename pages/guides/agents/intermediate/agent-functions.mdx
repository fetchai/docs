# Agent Functions

Agents can act as executable functions for the AI Engine. We can enable this by utilising Agentverse and registering
our agent's function on the platform. AI Engine then indexes the registered function and can then communicate with
your agent. Checkout the [Agents 101 for AI Engine ↗️](/guides/agent-courses/agents-for-ai#agent-agentverse-ai-engine-and-deltav) for a wider explanation of how this works.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Check out the [AI Engine package ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents-ai-engine/) to download it and start integrating your Agents with this tool!

      Current version of the package is <PackageVersion packageName="uagents-ai-engine" packageType="pypi" />.

## Local Agent Function registration

Sometimes you'll want to run an agent on your own hardware or infrastructure; luckily this is very easy to do on any system that support **Python 3.10**.

### Overview

This system is pretty simple and makes you get started as quickly as possible. You can run this agent on any device you'd like; in this scenario we're running on a VM but you could run this on your laptop, raspberry pi or tweak for [Agentverse ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro). On startup our script will register our agent to the [Almanac ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/almanac), and then our agent will be available to communicate with other agents. To get this agent to be [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav) accessible,  we will also go to Agentverse to create a new Function for the agent, to then allow this agent to be found in DeltaV.

### The agent

    ```py copy filename="agent.py"
    from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Protocol, Model
    import random
    from uagents import Field
    from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType
    import sys

    dungeons = Agent(
        name="dungeonsanddragonsdiceroll",
        port=6145,
        seed="RANDOM STRINGS",
        endpoint=["http://YOUR_IP:6145/submit"],
    )

    fund_agent_if_low(dungeons.wallet.address())

    @dungeons.on_event("startup")
    async def hi(ctx: Context):
        ctx.logger.info(dungeons.address)

    class Request(Model):
        dice_sides: int = Field(description="How many sides does your dice need?")

    dice_roll_protocol = Protocol("DungeonsAndDragonsDiceRoll")

    @dice_roll_protocol.on_message(model=Request, replies={UAgentResponse})
    async def roll_dice(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Request):
        result = str(random.randint(1, msg.dice_sides))
        message = f"Dice roll result: {result}"
        await ctx.send(
            sender, UAgentResponse(message=message, type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL)
        )


    dungeons.include(dice_roll_protocol, publish_manifest=True)

    dungeons.run()
     ```

It is important that you provide the `name`, `port`, `seed` and `endpoint` for your agent to correctly run this code.

A few things to note; you'll need to be running this agent on infrastructure that allows you to open a port, in our example we run on port `6145`.

The agent is initialised with an endpoint, and a port - this is so that we can receive messages, and other agents know where to send them. We call `fund_agent_if_low` to get some funds, if we need them. And we define our protocol, which is just an int as seen in the `Request` object.

Our `on_message` doesn't do much other than return a number between 1 and the defined `dice_sides` from the message inclusive. However, the response type is of  `UAgentResponse` which is essential to communicate with DeltaV.

`.run()` initialises the agent.

Finally, we  run our agent as follows: `python agent.py`

**Expected output**:

    ```
    INFO:     [dungeonsanddragonsdiceroll]: Manifest published successfully: DungeonsAndDragonsDiceRoll
    INFO:     [dungeonsanddragonsdiceroll]: Registering on almanac contract...
    INFO:     [dungeonsanddragonsdiceroll]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
    INFO:     [dungeonsanddragonsdiceroll]: agent1qvh76795enwgnzkrjpedlnqxwv83d8wxnkkcszs9z46zc3qpfs3yvzc5kuw
    INFO:     [dungeonsanddragonsdiceroll]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:6145 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```

### Register a local Agent Function on the Agentverse

For this example we set up a really simple Agent Function. For further information on Agent Functions and registration process, see [Register Agent Functions on the Agentverse ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services) resource.

To register **Local Agents and Functions**, you will first need to log in the [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/) and head over to the **My Agents** tab. Then, click on **Local Agents** tab and click one of the **Connect Local Agent** buttons.

![](src/images/guides/uagent/servicefordungeons_1.png)

You will need to provide the **local agent address** and make sure it is running on your terminal as only running agents can enroll Agent Functions on the Agentverse!

![](src/images/guides/uagent/servicefordungeons_2.png)

   <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
     If you see a message saying **"We couldn't find this agent address on Fetch Network"** you will need to wait for some time (around 5 minutes) until the protocols are uploaded successfully on the Fetch Network and your agent is retrievable.
   </Callout>

Once your agent is retrieved correctly, you will see a box depicting it within the **My Agents** tab. Click on it and head over to the **Deploy** tab and click on **+ New Function**. Here, you can now provide the needed details for your Agent Function in the dedicated fields. Remember to provide detailed descriptions for what your **Agent Function** does and the **Fields** for data Models expected. understanding of Functions fields descriptions.

![](src/images/guides/uagent/servicefordungeons_3.png)

It's recommended you alter the contract slightly, and follow the above steps so that you can run an agent, create a function for the agent and then have that agent accessible by DeltaV.

## Description of your Agent Function

The **Description** is super important to the success of your Agent Function. The [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) will catalogue descriptions and parse these into its understanding. Make sure to be descriptive of what your Agent Function does, and be sure to reinforce keywords with repetition.

Read more and see examples on how to properly set field descriptions by heading over to: [Field descriptions for DeltaV ↗️](/guides/services/field-descriptions-for-deltav) guide.

## Primary and Secondary Functions

**Primary** and **Secondary** functions are different but have strong similarities.

A **Primary Function** is the primary Agent Function and for instance, it could be an agent that would respond to a user or be accessible via DeltaV. _Primary Functions are expected to fully or partially fulfill an objective provided by users_.

Similarly, a **Secondary Function** is an Agent Sub-function providing secondary services that likely need additional context or information to carry out the Primary Function. _Secondary Functions are executed in combination with the Objective task_. If that's the case, DeltaV would see that the Agent Primary Function can be fulfilled by executing a Secondary Function, thus, it will contact this latter one which may or may not require gaining context directly from the user.

       DeltaV supports rich text and hyperlinks, enhancing formatting and navigation within the interface. You can include hyperlinks using standard HTML tags for clickable links.
