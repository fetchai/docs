# Using agents storage function

## Introduction

In this guide, we want to illustrate how storage functions are called and how to use them. We want to create an agent which gets a value from the storage (starting from 0) every second. Then prints it, and puts the new value back into the storage but increased by 1 unit.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have read the following resources before going on with this guide:

   - [Creating your first agent ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/create-a-uagent)
   - [Agent Handlers ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/handlers)

## Imports needed

   - [uAgents ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/)

## Walk-through

1. To start let's create a Python script and name it `storage.py`, we can do this in terminal with `touch storage.py`.

2. Then, we need to open the script in the text editor of choice and import the necessary classes, `Agent` and `Context`, from the `uagents` library.

3. Let's then create an agent named `alice` which logs a message every second using the `.on_interval()` decorator, indicating the current count. The `on_interval()` function takes a `Context` object as a parameter: the `Context` object contains a `storage` attribute, which is used to store and retrieve data between method calls:

   ```py copy filename="storage.py"
   from uagents import Agent, Context

   alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")

   @alice.on_interval(period=1.0)
   async def on_interval(ctx: Context):
       current_count = ctx.storage.get("count") or 0

       ctx.logger.info(f"My count is: {current_count}")

       ctx.storage.set("count", current_count + 1)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       alice.run()
   ```

   Here, the `on_interval()` function retrieves the current count from the storage attribute using the `ctx.storage.get()` method. It prints the `current_count` value, and then increments it by `1`, and stores the updated count back to the storage attribute using the `ctx.storage.set()` method. The current count is then logged using the `ctx.logger.info()` method.

4. Save the script.

## Run the script

On your terminal, make sure you activated the virtual environment.

Run the script: `python storage.py`

The output should look as follows:

    ```
    INFO:     [alice]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    INFO:     [alice]: My count is: 1
    INFO:     [alice]: My count is: 2
    INFO:     [alice]: My count is: 3
    ...
    ```
