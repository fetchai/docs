# Local Agent Inspector

The **Local Agent Inspector** is a developer tool on Agentverse that enhances the debugging and monitoring experience for [Agents running on a local infrastructure ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-types#local-agents). It allows you to track and understand the real-time behavior of these Agents, whether they are connected to Agentverse or not. The tool offers developers detailed insights into your local agent's performance and interactions, even though the agent itself is run within your infrastructure.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
        Local Agents can communicate and interact with other Agents and Functions connected to the Agentverse and Fetch Network through a Mailbox. For more information on Mailbox and how to connect local Agents and their function to the Agentverse, have a look at these guides:

            - [Agent Mailbox ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/mailbox).  
            - [Options for running local Agents ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/options-for-running-local-agents)
            - [Agent Functions ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-functions). 
            - [Agentverse Functions: register your Agents Functions on the Agentverse! ↗️](/guides/agentverse/agentverse-functions/registering-agent-services). 
    </Callout>

The **Local Agent Inspector** provides developers with key insights into their Agents, such as the Agent's address, local and external endpoints, message types, and detailed sender-recipient data. By visualizing detailed insights into your local agent's performance and interactions, the Inspector allows you to oversee how your Agent interacts with others, making it easier to optimize communication and troubleshoot complex, real-time tasks. This is particularly useful for Agents that handle local processing or resource management while interacting with other agents or systems.

All message data is presented in a list, with the option to access the payload of each message. For those managing multiple Agents, the Inspector provides a complete list of all running Agents. While support for Agents managed through a **Bureau** is coming soon, this will eventually offer a full view of all local Agents alongside relevant details.

In the future, the Inspector will allow direct connections between local Agents and Agentverse, enhancing the ease of managing and monitoring Agent interactions.

## How to access the Local Agent Inspector

You can access the Local Agent Inspector by first coding and defining your Agent. 

For instance, consider the following simple local Agent:

<GithubCodeSegment digest="36661e2d104e8d5150bdb124abcbb17c">
    <CodeSegment
        path="https://github.com/fetchai/uAgent-Examples/blob/main/5-documentation/guides/agents/intermediate/local-agent-inspector/agent_inspector_example.py"
        lineStart={1}
        lineEnd={25}
        hosted={true}
    />
</GithubCodeSegment>
<CodeGroup dynamic hasCopy isLocalHostedFile digest='36661e2d104e8d5150bdb124abcbb17c'>
<DocsCode local={true}>
	```py copy filename="agent_inspector_example.py"

	from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
	
	class Message(Model):
	    message: str
	
	
	bob = Agent(
	    name="Bob",
	    port=8001,
	    seed="BobSecretPhrase",
	    endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit"],
	)
	
	print(f"Your agent's address is: {bob.address}")
	
	
	@bob.on_message(model=Message)
	async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
	    ctx.logger.info(f'Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}')
	
	    await ctx.send(sender, Message(message="Hello There!"))
	
	
	if __name__ == "__main__":
	    bob.run()

```
</DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>

Once you successfully run your local Agent and register it into the Almanac (**Make sure your Agent has enough funds to do so!**), you will be able to access the Inspector via the terminal log, which provides a dedicated link to the Inspector page. 

By running the above Agent, the output you get should be similar to the following:

    ```
    Your agent's address is: agent1qvrapvpxltu54tt3qnud5mlkul9y9d9tfn7xfpq4ec74cq4mkym6yl3jkdw
    INFO:     [  Bob]: Registration on Almanac API successful
    INFO:     [  Bob]: Registering on almanac contract...
    INFO:     [  Bob]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
    INFO:     [  Bob]: Agent inspector available at https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8001&address=agent1q2kxet3vh0scsf0sm7y2erzz33cve6tv5uk63x64upw5g68kr0chkv7hw50
    INFO:     [  Bob]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```

By clicking on the dedicated link depicted here, you will then be redirected to the **Inspector Dashboard**. A pop-up message will appear saying that your Agent was connected successfully.

Here you can view all the information about your local Agent, including details about all messaged sent and received by the Agent.
