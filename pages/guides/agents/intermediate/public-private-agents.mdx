# Public and private agents

## Introduction

Transparency is a fundamental principle in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and blockchain systems. Within the Fetch.ai network, **users have the ability to determine the amount of information they wish to publish**. This is thanks to the ability for users to create Agents as either **public** or **private**, based on their **introspectivity** and **protocol exposure** through the [Agentverse ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro).

This allows users to provide greater flexibility to Agents, creating a balance between transparency and privacy for every operation they perform on the network.

## Defining public and private agents

There are two ways in which an Agent can be classified as public: they define an endpoint and/or, they publish their manifests:

        ```python

            agent = Agent(
                name="demo agent",
                seed=SEED,
                endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
            )
            agent.include(new_protocol, publish_manifest=True)
            agent.run()

        ```

Private Agents can be private in two ways: by hiding a protocol they use from public and/or by not defining an endpoint:

        ```python

            agent = Agent(
                name="private demo agent",
                seed=SEED,
            )
            agent.include(new_protocol, publish_manifest=False)
            agent.run()

        ```

You would need to share the IP of the private Agent you're running to the other Agent you're communicating with.
