# Hosted, Local, and Mailbox Agents

Agents can operate in multiple environments based on how they are created and deployed within the network. Understanding the difference between **Hosted**, **Local**, and **Mailbox Agents** is helpful for developers to correctly choose the right setup for their use cases and applications.

## Hosted Agents

[Hosted Agents ↗️](/guides/agentverse/creating-agentverse-agents/creating-a-hosted-agent) are cloud-based agents managed within the [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/), enabling developers to build, deploy, and run Agents without managing infrastructure. These Agents operate as functions, executing tasks and responding to triggers efficiently, keeping operational costs low for users. Hosted Agents manage their state differently: global variables reset after each function call. To maintain state across calls, developers must use Agent Storage, which is essential for creating Agents with stateful behavior.

Developers can start with a blank script or leverage predefined templates for common use cases, such as retrieving stock prices or finding nearby restaurants. These templates offer a quick start while allowing customization for specific needs.

A significant advantage of hosted Agents is their accessibility, as they eliminate the need for local dependencies. With an integrated `agent.py` file and support for a restricted set of imports, developers can still craft robust and versatile solutions. For a better reference to these topics, check out the following resources:

    - [Creating Hosted Agents ↗️](/guides/agentverse/creating-agentverse-agents/creating-a-hosted-agent).
    - [Agentverse: Allowed Imports ↗️](/guides/agentverse/creating-agentverse-agents/allowed-imports).
    - [How Agents handle their state ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/hosted-agent).

## Local Agents

Local Agents run directly on your machine or infrastructure, offering full control over environment, configuration, and execution. Unlike hosted Agents, they continuously handle real-time events, messages, and tasks without requiring an orchestrator, making them ideal for use cases needing persistent state and direct access to local resources.

With the uAgents Framework, local Agents support advanced integrations using any Python package or custom module, enabling flexibility in design and powerful capabilities like machine learning and data processing. They maintain persistent state across function executions, unlike hosted Agents, where global variables reset with each call. Running a local Agent involves setting up a Python environment, installing dependencies, and executing the Agent script. They can run continuously or within Docker containers for scalable deployment and process isolation.

Local Agents excel in high-performance applications, offering deep customization, resource management, and direct integration with local services, making them the go-to choice for complex, real-time solutions.

## Mailbox Agents

The [Agentverse Mailbox feature ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/mailbox) makes Agents a hybrid between Hosted and Local types. This because Local Agents may not always be online all the time due to network outages, being behind a firewall, or intentionally going offline for resource management. To manage such scenarios, the **Mailbox** feature in Agentverse allows Agents to receive messages while they are offline with ease. Once the Agent comes back online, it can retrieve these messages from its mailbox.

**Local Agents can use a Mailbox to ensure that no messages are lost when they are temporarily disconnected from the network**; the Mailbox acts as a message buffer, storing communications until the Agent comes back online and ready to process them. Indeed, this feature enables interaction with other Agents or functions without the Agent being online continuously.

In order to set up a mailbox for a local Agent, you first need to create and configure a local Agent. The Agent's address is used to register it on the Agentverse, and then to generate a **Mailbox API key** for your Agent. For instance, consider the following basic Agent:

<GithubCodeSegment digest="67d527d8ecb6cc3ea76fdce279b2a78a">
    <CodeSegment
        path="https://github.com/fetchai/uAgent-Examples/blob/main/5-documentation/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-types/mailbox_agent.py"
        lineStart={1}
        lineEnd={22}
        hosted={true}
    />
</GithubCodeSegment>
<CodeGroup dynamic hasCopy isLocalHostedFile digest='67d527d8ecb6cc3ea76fdce279b2a78a'>

<DocsCode local={true}>
	```py copy filename="mailbox_agent.py"

	from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
	
	
	class Message(Model):
	    message: str
	
	
	AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY = "put_your_AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY_here"
	SEED_PHRASE = "put_your_seed_phrase_here"
	
	# Now your agent is ready to join the agentverse!
	agent = Agent(
	    name="alice",
	    seed=SEED_PHRASE,
	    mailbox=f"{AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY}@https://agentverse.ai"
	)
	
	# Copy the address shown below
	print(f"Your agent's address is: {agent.address}")
	
	if __name__ == "__main__":
	    agent.run()

```
</DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>



Then, head over to the [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/) and navigate to the **My Agents** tab. Here, select **Local Agents** and click on **Connect Local Agent**. Paste your Agent's address retrieved from running your local Agent and follow the steps until you get a **Mailbox API Key**, which you will use to update your Agent's configuration above. To test your Mailbox setup, you can create another Agent (on Agentverse for instance) that sends messages to the Mailbox while the first Agent is offline. When the first agent comes back online, it will retrieve and process the stored messages. For a complete example, check out this [guide ↗️](/guides/agentverse/agentverse-mailbox/utilising-the-mailbox).
