# Communicating with other agents

## Introduction

Communication is an essential feature within any agents network. Communication allows agents to work together, exchange information, and forms an organic marketplace.

In this guide, we will explore two methods of communication between agents:

    - **Local communication**.
    - **Remote communication** via the [Almanac Contract ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview).

Let's start with **local communication**. This is the first step you would need to undertake to familiarize yourself with the code syntax we will be using in the **remote communication** section.

## Agents: Local Communication

### Walk-through

The first step to better understand how agents communicate is to introduce how 2 agents perform a local communication. Let's consider a basic example in which two agents say hello to each other.

1. First of all, let's create a Python script for this task:

    <CodeGroup isOSFile>

        ```py copy filename="mac"
        touch agents_communication.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="windows"
        echo. > agents_communication.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
        touch agents_communication.py
        ```

    </CodeGroup>
   
2. Then, we import  `Agent`, `Context`, `Bureau`, and `Model` from the uagents library and we then define the message structure for messages to be exchanged between the agents using the class `Model`:

    ```py copy
    from uagents import Agent, Bureau, Context, Model

    class Message(Model):
        message: str
   ```

    The `Message` class defines the structure of message we can receive. In this example it's just a string, but it could be a simple integer, or a complex object too.

3. Now we create two agent instances, `sigmar` and `slaanesh`, with `name` and `seed` parameters:

    ```py copy
    sigmar = Agent(name="sigmar", seed="sigmar recovery phrase")
    slaanesh = Agent(name="slaanesh", seed="slaanesh recovery phrase")
    ```

    In this example we're running multiple agents from one file.

4. Let's now define `sigmar`'s behaviors. We need to define a function for `sigmar` to send messages to `slaanesh` periodically:

    ```py copy
    @sigmar.on_interval(period=3.0)
    async def send_message(ctx: Context):
       await ctx.send(slaanesh.address, Message(message="hello there slaanesh"))
   ```

    We can use the `.on_interval()` decorator to define a coroutine `send_message()` function that will be called every 3 seconds. The coroutine function sends a message to `slaanesh` using the `ctx.send()` method of the `Context` object.

5. We then need to define a `sigmar_message_handler()` function for `sigmar` to manage incoming messages:

    ```py copy
    @sigmar.on_message(model=Message)
    async def sigmar_message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")
   ```

    This defines the coroutine function `sigmar_message_handler()` that serves as a message handler for `sigmar`. It is triggered whenever `sigmar` receives a message of type `Message`.

6. Let's now define the behavior of our second agent, `slaanesh`:

    ```py copy
    @slaanesh.on_message(model=Message)
    async def slaanesh_message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")
        await ctx.send(sigmar.address, Message(message="hello there sigmar"))
   ```

    Same as `sigmar` however, we make `slaanesh` compose a response message to be sent back using the `ctx.send()` method with `sigmar.address` as the recipient address and an instance of the `Message` model as the message payload.

    It would also be valid to respond to the sender:

     ```py copy
     await ctx.send(sender.address, Message(message="hello there sigmar"))
     ```

7. Let's then use the `Bureau` class to create a `Bureau` object. This will allow us to run agents together in the same script:

    ```py copy
    bureau = Bureau()
    bureau.add(sigmar)
    bureau.add(slaanesh)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        bureau.run()
   ```

8. Save the script.

The complete script should be looking as follows:

```py copy filename="agents_communication.py"
from uagents import Agent, Bureau, Context, Model

class Message(Model):
    message: str

sigmar = Agent(name="sigmar", seed="sigmar recovery phrase")
slaanesh = Agent(name="slaanesh", seed="slaanesh recovery phrase")

@sigmar.on_interval(period=3.0)
async def send_message(ctx: Context):
   await ctx.send(slaanesh.address, Message(message="hello there slaanesh"))

@sigmar.on_message(model=Message)
async def sigmar_message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

@slaanesh.on_message(model=Message)
async def slaanesh_message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")
    await ctx.send(sigmar.address, Message(message="hello there sigmar"))

bureau = Bureau()
bureau.add(sigmar)
bureau.add(slaanesh)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bureau.run()
```

We are now ready to run the script: `python agents_communication.py`

The output would be:

    ```
    INFO:     [bureau]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    INFO:     [sigmar]: Received message from agent1q0mau8vkmg78xx0sh8cyl4tpl4ktx94pqp2e94cylu6haugt2hd7j9vequ7: hello there sigmar
    INFO:     [slaanesh]: Received message from agent1qww3ju3h6kfcuqf54gkghvt2pqe8qp97a7nzm2vp8plfxflc0epzcjsv79t: hello there slaanesh
    INFO:     [sigmar]: Received message from agent1q0mau8vkmg78xx0sh8cyl4tpl4ktx94pqp2e94cylu6haugt2hd7j9vequ7: hello there sigmar
    INFO:     [slaanesh]: Received message from agent1qww3ju3h6kfcuqf54gkghvt2pqe8qp97a7nzm2vp8plfxflc0epzcjsv79t: hello there slaanesh
    INFO:     [sigmar]: Received message from agent1q0mau8vkmg78xx0sh8cyl4tpl4ktx94pqp2e94cylu6haugt2hd7j9vequ7: hello there sigmar
    ```

## Agents Remote Communication: the Almanac Contract

An agent must register to the  [Almanac contract ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview) to communicate, to search for other agents or be found. Agents can query this contract to retrieve an HTTP endpoint for a recipient agent. [Registration in the Almanac ↗️](/guides/agents/register-in-almanac) requires paying a small fee, so make sure to have enough funds to allow for this. You can query the Almanac now, by using the search feature on [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/).

Whenever an agent registers in the Almanac, it must specify the service [endpoints ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/endpoints) alongside a weight parameter for each endpoint provided. Agents trying to communicate with your agent will choose the service endpoints using a weighted random selection.

Here, we show you how to create two agents and make them remotely communicate by registering and using the Almanac Contract.

### Walk-through

The first step would be to create two different Python scripts for this task, each one representing a remote agent:

    Slaanesh:

    <CodeGroup isOSFile>

        ```py copy filename="mac"
        touch remote_agents_slaanesh.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="windows"
        echo. > remote_agents_slaanesh.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
        touch remote_agents_slaanesh.py
        ```

    </CodeGroup>

    Sigmar:

    <CodeGroup isOSFile>

        ```py copy filename="mac"
        touch remote_agents_sigmar.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="windows"
        echo. > remote_agents_sigmar.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
        touch remote_agents_sigmar.py
        ```

    </CodeGroup>
Let's start by defining the script for **sigmar**.

#### Sigmar

1. In `remote_agents_sigmar.py` script, we would need to import the necessary classes from the `uagents` (`Agent`, `Context`, and `Model`) and from `uagents.setup` (`fund_agent_if_low`). We then need to define the message structure for messages to be exchanged between agents using the class `Model`, as well as the `RECIPIENT_ADDRESS` (slaanesh's address). Note that if you don't know slaanesh's address yet, you can use `print(slaanesh.address)` after defining agent `slaanesh` to get this information. This is the address towards which `sigmar` will send messages:

    ```py copy
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
    from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

    class Message(Model):
        message: str

    RECIPIENT_ADDRESS="agent1qvm7v76zs6w2x90xvq99yc5xh7c2thjtm44zc09me556zxnra627gkf4zum"
   ```

2. Let's now create our agent, `sigmar`, by providing `name`, `seed`, `port`, and `endpoint`. Also, make sure it has enough funds to register in the Almanac contract:

    ```py copy
    sigmar = Agent(
        name="sigmar",
        port=8000,
        seed="sigmar secret phrase",
        endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
    )

    fund_agent_if_low(sigmar.wallet.address())
   ```

    On the Fetch.ai testnet, you can use the `fund_agent_if_low` function. This checks if the balance of the agent's wallet is below a certain threshold, and if so, sends a transaction to fund the wallet with a specified amount of cryptocurrency. In this case, it checks if the balance of `sigmar`'s wallet is low and funds it if necessary.

3. We are ready to define `sigmar`'s behaviors. Let's start with a function for `sigmar` to send messages:

    ```py copy
    @sigmar.on_interval(period=2.0)
    async def send_message(ctx: Context):
        await ctx.send(RECIPIENT_ADDRESS, Message(message="hello there slaanesh")
   ```

    Here, the `.on_interval()` decorator schedules the `send_message()` function to be run every 2 seconds. Inside the function, there is an asynchronous call indicated by the `ctx.send()` method. This call sends a message with the content `"hello there slaanesh"` to the `RECIPIENT_ADDRESS`.

4. We then need to define a function for `sigmar` to handle incoming messages from other agents:

    ```py copy
    @sigmar.on_message(model=Message)
    async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        sigmar.run()
   ```

    Here, we have used the `.on_message()` decorator to register the `message_handler()` coroutine function as a handler for incoming messages of type `Message`.

    The `message_handler()` function takes three arguments: `ctx`, `sender`, and `msg`. Inside this function, we call the `ctx.logger.info()` method to log information about the received message, including the sender and message content.

5. We can now save the script.

The overall script for sigmar agent should be looking as follows:

```py copy filename="remote_agents_sigmar.py"
from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

class Message(Model):
    message: str

RECIPIENT_ADDRESS="agent1qvm7v76zs6w2x90xvq99yc5xh7c2thjtm44zc09me556zxnra627gkf4zum"

sigmar = Agent(
    name="sigmar",
    port=8000,
    seed="sigmar secret phrase",
    endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
)

fund_agent_if_low(sigmar.wallet.address())

@sigmar.on_interval(period=2.0)
async def send_message(ctx: Context):
    await ctx.send(RECIPIENT_ADDRESS, Message(message="hello there slaanesh"))

@sigmar.on_message(model=Message)
async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sigmar.run()
```

Remember that you need to provide the `name`, `seed`, `port`, `endpoint` and `RECIPIENT_ADDRESS` parameters to correctly run this code.

We can now proceed by writing the script for agent `slaanesh`.

#### Slaanesh

1. In `remote_agents_slaanesh.py` script, import the necessary classes from the `uagents` and `uagents.setup`. Then, define the message structure for messages to be exchanged between the agents using the `Model` class, as well as our second uAgent, `slaanesh`, by providing `name`, `seed`, `port`, and `endpoint`. Make sure it has enough funds to register in the Almanac contract:

    ```py copy
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
    from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

    class Message(Model):
        message: str

    slaanesh = Agent(
        name="slaanesh",
        port=8001,
        seed="slaanesh secret phrase",
        endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit"],
    )

    fund_agent_if_low(slaanesh.wallet.address())
   ```

2. Let's now define a function for `slaanesh` to handle incoming messages and answering back to the sender:

    ```py copy
    @slaanesh.on_message(model=Message)
    async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

        await ctx.send(sender, Message(message="hello there sigmar"))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        slaanesh.run()
   ```

    Here, we have defined an asynchronous `message_handler()` function for slaanesh to handle incoming messages from other uAgents. The function is decorated with `.on_message()`, and it is triggered whenever a message of type `Message` is received by `slaanesh`. When a message is received, the handler function logs the sender's address and the content of the message. It then sends a response back to the sender using the `ctx.send()` with a new message. The response message contains the `Message` data model with a `"hello there sigmar"` message.

3. Save the script.

The overall script for `slaanesh` should be looking as follows:

```py copy filename="remote_agents_slaanesh.py"
from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low
from uagents import Agent, Context, Model

class Message(Model):
    message: str

slaanesh = Agent(
    name="slaanesh",
    port=8001,
    seed="slaanesh secret phrase",
    endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit"],
)

fund_agent_if_low(slaanesh.wallet.address())

@slaanesh.on_message(model=Message)
async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

    await ctx.send(sender, Message(message="hello there sigmar"))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    slaanesh.run()
```

Remember that you need to provide the `name`, `seed`, `port` and `endpoint` parameters to correctly run this code.

#### Run the scripts

In different terminal windows, first run `slaanesh` and then `sigmar`. They will register automatically in the Almanac contract using their funds. The received messages will print out in each terminal:

    Terminal 1: `python remote_agents_slaanesh.py`

    Terminal 2: `python remote_agents_sigmar.py`

The output will depend on the terminal:

- **Sigmar**:

    ```
    INFO:     [sigmar]: Registering on almanac contract...
    INFO:     [sigmar]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
    INFO:     [sigmar]: Received message from agent1qvm7v76zs6w2x90xvq99yc5xh7c2thjtm44zc09me556zxnra627gkf4zum: hello there sigmar

    ```

- **Slaanesh**:

    ```
    INFO:     [slaanesh]: Registering on almanac contract...
    INFO:     [slaanesh]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
    INFO:     [slaanesh]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

    INFO:     [slaanesh]: Received message from agent1qvwqu6a0km09mq4f6j6kmke9smswmgcergmml9a54av9449rqtmmxy4qwe6: hello there slaanesh
    ```

### Before we go on...

As we touched on before in [Register in Almanac ↗️](/guides/agents/register-in-almanac), when the agent uses `.run()` function this tells the `uagents` library to register the agent to the Almanac. It's simple, agents initialize themselves, and register to a service which acts as a search engine for agents (the Almanac) then, when agents receive messages they can respond.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we explored two different methods of communication for Agents using the `uagents` library:

    - **Local communication**.
    - **Remote communication** via the Almanac Contract.

For _local communication_, we learned how to use the `uagents` library to create two agents, `sigmar` and `slaanesh`, and enable them to exchange messages with one another. We defined the message structure using the `Model` class and implemented message handlers for both agents. By running the script we observed their real-time message exchange.

Next, we delved into _remote communication_, which facilitates interaction between agents through the Almanac Contract. This method requires registering the agents in the Almanac Contract and querying for **HTTP endpoints** for communication. By running the scripts separately, we could observe the real-time messages exchange, fostering a decentralized network of interacting agents.

With this, we suspect you're ready to start building agents, as part of multi agent system the Almanac allows; awesome. If you want to go further though, take a look at the [message verification ↗️](/guides/agents/message-verification) and [sending tokens ↗️](/guides/agents/send-tokens), after-all you do want to be sure you are speaking to who you think you are, and agents getting paid is awesome.
