# How to use agents to send tokens

## Introduction

Within agent-based decentralized systems, efficient communication and secure data exchange are essential. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up two AI Agents utilizing the `uagents` library to establish a dynamic workflow where one agent periodically sends payment requests to another, which in turn processes these requests, executes transactions, and provides transaction information back to sending agent.

Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have read the following resources before going on with this guide:

    - [Quick Start Guide for uAgents Framework ↗️](/guides/agents/quickstart)
    - [Creating your first agent ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/create-a-uagent)
    - [Agents address ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/getting-uagent-address)
    - [Using agents storage function ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/storage-function)
    - [Communicating with other agents ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/communicating-with-other-agents)

## Imports needed

    - [uAgents ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/)

## Walk-through

1. First of all, create a Python script for this task, and name it:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
```py copy filename="mac"
touch sending_tokens.py
```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > sending_tokens.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch sending_tokens.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>
</CodeGroup>
   
2. Then, import the necessary modules from `uagents`, `uagents.network`, and `uagents.setup`. Let's then define two data models: `PaymentRequest` and `TransactionInfo`. We then need to set up the values for the `AMOUNT` and `DENOM` variables, which define the default amount and denomination for the payment requests:

    ```py copy
    from uagents import Agent, Bureau, Context, Model
    from uagents.network import wait_for_tx_to_complete
    from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

    class PaymentRequest(Model):
        wallet_address: str
        amount: int
        denom: str

    class TransactionInfo(Model):
        tx_hash: str

    AMOUNT = 100
    DENOM = "atestfet"
    ```

   - The `PaymentRequest` model represents a payment request which contains the `wallet_address`, `amount`, and `denom`.

   - The `TransactionInfo` model represents information about a transaction and contains a single attribute, `tx_hash`.

3. Let's now define our agents, `alice` and `bob`. Ensure they have enough funds in their wallets to carry out transactions:

    ```py copy
    alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice secret phrase")
    bob = Agent(name="bob", seed="bob secret phrase")

    fund_agent_if_low(bob.wallet.address(), min_balance=AMOUNT)
    ```

4. We can now define our agents behaviour and functions:

    ```py copy
    @alice.on_interval(period=10.0)
    async def request_funds(ctx: Context):
        await ctx.send(
            bob.address,
            PaymentRequest(
                wallet_address=str(alice.wallet.address()), amount=AMOUNT, denom=DENOM
            ),
        )
    ```

   This defines an event handler for `alice` using the `.on_interval()` decorator. This event handler is triggered at regular intervals of `10.0` seconds in this case. The event handler function is named `request_funds()` and takes a `ctx` parameter of type `Context`. Within the function, `alice` sends a payment request message to `bob` by using the `ctx.send()` method. The `ctx.send()` method is called with the recipient address, `bob.address`, which specifies that the message should be sent to `bob`. The message is an instance of the `PaymentRequest()` model. It contains `alice`'s wallet address (`alice.wallet.address()`), the amount (`AMOUNT`), and the denomination (`DENOM`).

5. We can now define a `confirm_transaction()` message handler for `alice` to handle incoming messages from `bob` of type `TransactionInfo`:

    ```py copy
    @alice.on_message(model=TransactionInfo)
    async def confirm_transaction(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: TransactionInfo):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received transaction info from {sender}: {msg}")
        tx_resp = await wait_for_tx_to_complete(msg.tx_hash, ctx.ledger)

        coin_received = tx_resp.events["coin_received"]
        if (
            coin_received["receiver"] == str(alice.wallet.address())
            and coin_received["amount"] == f"{AMOUNT}{DENOM}"
        ):
            ctx.logger.info(f"Transaction was successful: {coin_received}")
    ```

   The event handler function is named `confirm_transaction()` and takes three parameters: `ctx`, `sender`, and `msg`. Within the function, `alice` logs an informational message using the `ctx.logger.info()` method, indicating the receipt of transaction information from the sender agent, `bob`, and displaying the `msg` object. The `wait_for_tx_to_complete()` function is used to await the completion of the transaction specified by the `tx_hash` received in the message.

   Once the transaction is completed, the code accesses the `coin_received` event from the transaction response using `tx_resp.events[\"coin_received\"]`. It checks if the receiver address matches `alice`'s wallet address (`alice.wallet.address()`) and if the amount received matches the expected amount (`AMOUNT + DENOM`).

   If the conditions are met, `alice` logs another informational message indicating the success of the transaction and displaying the details of the received coins.

6. Let's now define an event handler for `bob`. This event handler is triggered when `bob` receives a message of type `PaymentRequest` from `alice`:

    ```py copy
    @bob.on_message(model=PaymentRequest, replies=TransactionInfo)
    async def send_payment(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: PaymentRequest):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received payment request from {sender}: {msg}")

        # send the payment
        transaction = ctx.ledger.send_tokens(
            msg.wallet_address, msg.amount, msg.denom, bob.wallet
        )

        # send the tx hash so alice can confirm
        await ctx.send(alice.address, TransactionInfo(tx_hash=transaction.tx_hash))
    ```

   The event handler function is named `send_payment()` and takes three parameters: `ctx`, `sender`, and `msg`. Within the function, `bob` logs an informational message using the `ctx.logger.info()` method, indicating the receipt of a payment request from the sender agent, `bob`, and displaying the `msg` object.

   Next, the code performs a payment transaction using the `ctx.ledger.send_tokens()` method. It takes the wallet address (`msg.wallet_address`), amount (`msg.amount`), denomination (`msg.denom`), and `bob.wallet()` as parameters. This method is responsible for sending the requested payment.

   Once the transaction is completed, `bob` sends a message back to `alice` to inform her about the transaction, using `ctx.send()`. The message is created using the `TransactionInfo` model with the `tx_hash` obtained from the transaction response. The `ctx.send()` method is used to send this message to alice using her address (`alice.address`).

7. We are now ready to use the Bureau class to create a `bureau` object and add both uAgents to it so for them to be run together:

    ```py copy
    bureau = Bureau()
    bureau.add(alice)
    bureau.add(bob)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        bureau.run()
    ```

The overall script for this example should look as follows:

```py copy filename="sending_tokens.py"
from uagents import Agent, Bureau, Context, Model
from uagents.network import wait_for_tx_to_complete
from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

class PaymentRequest(Model):
    wallet_address: str
    amount: int
    denom: str

class TransactionInfo(Model):
    tx_hash: str

AMOUNT = 100
DENOM = "atestfet"

alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice secret phrase")
bob = Agent(name="bob", seed="bob secret phrase")

fund_agent_if_low(bob.wallet.address(), min_balance=AMOUNT)

@alice.on_interval(period=10.0)
async def request_funds(ctx: Context):
    await ctx.send(
        bob.address,
        PaymentRequest(
            wallet_address=str(alice.wallet.address()), amount=AMOUNT, denom=DENOM
        ),
    )

@alice.on_message(model=TransactionInfo)
async def confirm_transaction(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: TransactionInfo):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received transaction info from {sender}: {msg}")
    tx_resp = await wait_for_tx_to_complete(msg.tx_hash, ctx.ledger)

    coin_received = tx_resp.events["coin_received"]
    if (
        coin_received["receiver"] == str(alice.wallet.address())
        and coin_received["amount"] == f"{AMOUNT}{DENOM}"
    ):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Transaction was successful: {coin_received}")

@bob.on_message(model=PaymentRequest, replies=TransactionInfo)
async def send_payment(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: PaymentRequest):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received payment request from {sender}: {msg}")

    # send the payment
    transaction = ctx.ledger.send_tokens(
        msg.wallet_address, msg.amount, msg.denom, bob.wallet
    )

    # send the tx hash so alice can confirm
    await ctx.send(alice.address, TransactionInfo(tx_hash=transaction.tx_hash))

bureau = Bureau()
bureau.add(alice)
bureau.add(bob)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bureau.run()
```

## Run the script

On your terminal, make sure to have activated the virtual environment.

Run the script: `python sending_tokens.py`

The output should be as follows:

    ```
