# Broadcast

## Introduction to `ctx.broadcast()`

The `ctx.broadcast()` function is used within an agent to send a message to all other agents that support a specific protocol. It is a powerful method when you want to communicate with multiple agents at once without knowing their addresses beforehand. This is especially useful in systems where many agents may be participating in the same protocol, and you want to notify or query all of them simultaneously.

Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

## Bureau Walkthrough

### Overview

In this guide, we will create a multi-agent broadcast system using the `uagents` library. Three agents will be initialized: Ethan, Olivia, and Liam. Ethan and Olivia will support a defined communication protocol, while Liam will broadcast a message to all agents supporting this protocol and handle their responses. We’ll use `ctx.broadcast` to manage communication between agents and demonstrate the structure of message handling within the context of the `uagents` framework.

### Step 1: Import Classes and Initialize Agents

```py
from uagents import Agent, Bureau, Context, Model, Protocol

ethan = Agent(name="ethan", seed="ethan recovery phrase")
olivia = Agent(name="olivia", seed="olivia recovery phrase")
liam = Agent(name="liam", seed="liam recovery phrase")

```
In this step, we import the core classes needed to define agents, protocols, and message handling. We then initialize three agents: Ethan, Olivia, and Liam, each with unique seed phrases, ensuring fixed addresses for their identities.

### Step 2: Define Message Models

```py
class BroadcastExampleRequest(Model):
    pass

class BroadcastExampleResponse(Model):
    text: str

```

We define two message models:

- `BroadcastExampleRequest`: This model represents a request message (empty for now).
- `BroadcastExampleResponse`: This model holds a response message containing a text field.

### Step 3: Define a Communication Protocol

```py
proto = Protocol(name="proto", version="1.0")

```

A protocol named proto with version 1.0 is defined. This protocol will govern communication between agents that support it.

### Step 5: Message Handler for Broadcast Requests

```py

@proto.on_message(model=BroadcastExampleRequest, replies=BroadcastExampleResponse)
async def handle_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, _msg: BroadcastExampleRequest):
    await ctx.send(
        sender, BroadcastExampleResponse(text=f"Hello from {ctx.agent.name}")
    )

```

This function handles incoming `BroadcastExampleRequest` messages. When an agent (e.g., Ethan or Olivia) receives a request, it replies with a `BroadcastExampleResponse`, sending a message containing its own name.

### Step 6: Include the Protocol in Agents

```py
ethan.include(proto)
olivia.include(proto)

```

We include the protocol in Ethan and Olivia. This allows them to participate in communication governed by the `proto` protocol.

### Step 7: Liam's Behavior - Broadcasting and Handling Responses

```py
@liam.on_interval(period=5)
async def say_hello(ctx: Context):
    status_list = await ctx.broadcast(proto.digest, message=BroadcastExampleRequest())
    ctx.logger.info(f"Trying to contact {len(status_list)} agents.")

```

The `say_hello` function is executed by Liam every 5 seconds (using `on_interval`). Liam sends a `BroadcastExampleRequest` message to all agents supporting the `proto` protocol via `ctx.broadcast`. The `proto.digest` is used to identify the protocol.

```py
@liam.on_message(model=BroadcastExampleResponse)
async def handle_response(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: BroadcastExampleResponse):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received response from {sender}: {msg.text}")

```

When Liam receives a BroadcastExampleResponse, the handle_response function logs the sender and the content of the message.

### Step 8: Run the Bureau

```py
bureau = Bureau(port=8000, endpoint="http://localhost:8000/submit")
bureau.add(ethan)
bureau.add(olivia)
bureau.add(liam)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bureau.run()

```

## Explanation of ctx.broadcast

The broadcast() method in the Context class allows an agent to send a message to multiple agents that support a specific protocol. Here's a detailed look at its usage:

`status_list = await ctx.broadcast(proto.digest, message=BroadcastExampleRequest())`

- `proto.digest`: This is a unique identifier for the protocol that the message will be sent under. Only agents supporting this protocol will receive the broadcast.
- `message`: The message being broadcast, in this case, a BroadcastExampleRequest.
- `status_list`: This is a list of statuses returned by the broadcast, indicating which agents were successfully contacted.

By calling broadcast, Liam attempts to contact all agents supporting the proto protocol. This communication is asynchronous and can target multiple agents concurrently.

The overall script for this example should look as follows:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isLocalHostedFile>
    <DocsCode local={true}>

    ```py filename="broadcast-agent.py"
    from uagents import Agent, Bureau, Context, Model, Protocol

    ethan = Agent(name="ethan", seed="ethan recovery phrase", port=8000, endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"])
    olivia = Agent(name="olivia", seed="olivia recovery phrase", port=8001, endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit"])
    liam = Agent(name="liam", seed="liam recovery phrase", port=8002, endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8002/submit"])

    class BroadcastExampleRequest(Model):
        pass

    class BroadcastExampleResponse(Model):
        text: str

    proto = Protocol(name="proto", version="1.0")

    @proto.on_message(model=BroadcastExampleRequest, replies=BroadcastExampleResponse)
    async def handle_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, _msg: BroadcastExampleRequest):
        await ctx.send(
            sender, BroadcastExampleResponse(text=f"Hello from {ctx.agent.name}")
        )

    ethan.include(proto)
    olivia.include(proto)

    @liam.on_interval(period=5)
    async def say_hello(ctx: Context):
        status_list = await ctx.broadcast(proto.digest, message=BroadcastExampleRequest())
        ctx.logger.info(f"Trying to contact {len(status_list)} agents.")

    @liam.on_message(model=BroadcastExampleResponse)
    async def handle_response(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: BroadcastExampleResponse):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received response from {sender}: {msg.text}")

    bureau = Bureau(port=8000, endpoint="http://localhost:8000/submit")
    bureau.add(ethan)
    bureau.add(olivia)
    bureau.add(liam)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        bureau.run()

    ```
    </DocsCode>
</CodeGroup>

We are now ready to run the script: `python broadcast-agent.py`

The output would be:
