# Agent Mailboxes

## Introduction

Agents can't always be online; internet loss will cut your agent off from the network, or perhaps your agent is
behind a firewall meaning you cannot accept inbound requests. To get around online requirements we created
the **Mailbox** feature on [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai). A Mailbox is a
middleman that acts as a mailbox for all communication to your agent. Messages are stored within the mailbox and your
agents will collect them (calls for these in [uAgents library ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/uAgents/blob/55fd0f1bd14d4d5fdaaa3dae82e4d6c6c5b9a3cd/python/src/uagents/mailbox.py#L65)) when they're online
again.

Let's create a local Agent and connect it to the Agentverse via a Mailbox.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have read the following resources before going on with this guide:

    - [Quick Start Guide for uAgents Framework ↗️](/guides/agents/quickstart)
    - [Creating your first agent ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/create-a-uagent)
    - [Agents address ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/getting-uagent-address)
    - [Agent Handlers ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/handlers)
    - [Almanac contract ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/almanac)
    - [Register in Almanac ↗️](/guides/agents/register-in-almanac)

## Imports needed

    - [uAgents ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/)

## Local agent setup

<CodeGroup dynamic hasCopy isLocalHostedFile digest='46da63dae693d306d3687b4ce70466a9'>

<DocsCode local={true}>
	```py copy filename="mailbox_agent.py"

    from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
    
    
    class Message(Model):
        message: str
    
    
    SEED_PHRASE = "put_your_seed_phrase_here"
    
    # Now your agent is ready to join the agentverse!
    agent = Agent(
        name="alice",
        seed=SEED_PHRASE,
        port=8000,
        mailbox=True
    )
    
    # Copy the address shown below
    print(f"Your agent's address is: {agent.address}")
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent.run()
    ```
</DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>



Importantly, you need to provide the `SEED_PHRASE`, `name`, `seed` and `port` parameters to correctly run this example. You also need to set `mailbox=True` to correctly connect your Agent to the Agentverse through the Mailbox.

You should get something similar within your terminal output:

        ```
        INFO:     [Alice]: Starting agent with address: agent1qw8jn3nfl2fyyhe7v4x8pfmsge4hs9zqrqw9eq7h7hluzmd0da8z7j0uacx

        INFO:     [Alice]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8002 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
        INFO:     [Alice]: Starting mailbox client for https://agentverse.ai
        INFO:     [Alice]: Mailbox access token acquired

        INFO:     [Alice]: Registering on almanac contract...
        INFO:     [Alice]: Registering on almanac contract...complete

        ```

## Create a Mailbox in Agentverse

Now that we defined our local Agent and have successfully run it, we can go on and connect it to the [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai) via a Mailbox. To do so, make sure your Agent is running. Then, click on the [Local Agent Inspector ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/local-agent-inspector) URL provided in your terminal output. You will be redirected towards the Inspector UI and will be able to see multiple details about this local Agent. 

Here, click the **Connect** button.

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse-mailbox/mailbox_1a.png)

You will be presented with 3 different choices: **Mailbox**, **Proxy** and **Custom**. Select **Mailbox**.

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse-mailbox/mailbox_2a.png)

You will then see some code details available for the Agent. You do not need to do anything, just click on **Finish**.

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse-mailbox/mailbox_3a.png)

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse-mailbox/mailbox_4a.png)

You should now be able to see an additional line within your terminal output like shown below:

        ```
        INFO:     [Alice]: Starting agent with address: agent1qw8jn3nfl2fyyhe7v4x8pfmsge4hs9zqrqw9eq7h7hluzmd0da8z7j0uacx
        INFO:     [Alice]: Agent inspector available at https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8002&address=agent1qw8jn3nfl2fyyhe7v4x8pfmsge4hs9zqrqw9eq7h7hluzmd0da8z7j0uacx
        INFO:     [Alice]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8002 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
        INFO:     [Alice]: Starting mailbox client for https://agentverse.ai
        INFO:     [Alice]: Mailbox access token acquired
        INFO:     [Alice]: Registration on Almanac API successful
        INFO:     [Alice]: Registering on almanac contract...
        INFO:     [Alice]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
        INFO:     [mailbox]: Successfully registered as mailbox agent in Agentverse
        ```

You can view your recently connected local Agent by heading to the **Agentverse My Agents** tab and by clicking on **Local Agents**.
You will see a box for the local Agent recently connected.

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse-mailbox/mailbox_5a.png)

Cool! You have correctly set up a mailbox for the Agent. You can additionally add some further details to the local Agent such as the `README.md` file. To do so, create a file in your local Agent folder and name it `README.md` (You can instead provide the path towards it if you wish). In the file, add all the needed details and save it. Then, add the following bits to your local Agent code:

	```py copy

    agent = Agent(
        name="Alice",
        seed=SEED_PHRASE,
        port=8000,
        mailbox=True,
        readme_path="README.md",
        publish_agent_details=True
    )

    ```

Then, run the Agent once again and head over to the Inspector UI and connect the Agent again through the Mailbox as we previously showed. Once you do so, you can the head over to the **Local Agents tab** under Agentverse My Agents page and click on the local Agent box. You should be able to see the `README.md` file opening up with the content you provided locally:

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse-mailbox/mailbox_6a.png)

## Creating a second Agent

Let's create and run a second Agent to message Alice every 3 seconds. You need to provide the `ALICE_ADDRESS`, `name` and `seed` parameters to correctly run this code:

        lineStart={1}
        lineEnd={20}
        hosted={true}
    />
</GithubCodeSegment>
<CodeGroup dynamic hasCopy isLocalHostedFile digest='03eb3122058ee19a17748a48cae5dc13'>

<DocsCode local={true}>
	```py copy filename="test_agent.py"

	from uagents import Agent, Bureau, Context, Model
	from datetime import datetime
	
	
	class Message(Model):
	    message: str
	
	
	agent_2 = Agent(name="agent_2", seed="agent_2 recovery phrase", port=8001, endpoint="http://localhost:8001/submit")
	
	ALICE_ADDRESS = "add_address_of_alice_agent"
	
	
	@agent_2.on_interval(period=3.0)
	async def send_message(ctx: Context):
	    await ctx.send(ALICE_ADDRESS, Message(message=f"hello {datetime.today().date()}"))
	
	
	if __name__ == "__main__":
	    agent_2.run()

```
</DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>



## Testing

With both `alice` and `agent_2` running, stop `alice` and let `agent_2` run for a further 20 seconds, or so.

The output should be similar to the following, depending on the terminal window:

- Alice: 

  ```
  INFO:     [Alice]: Starting agent with address: agent1qw8jn3nfl2fyyhe7v4x8pfmsge4hs9zqrqw9eq7h7hluzmd0da8z7j0uacx

  INFO:     [Alice]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8002 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

  INFO:     [mailbox]: Successfully registered as mailbox agent in Agentverse
  INFO:     [Alice]: Received message from agent1qvzc3svtjv6dt9pql8ec7sfeuwfjmdg6ptafs9zc55ppvdwl5fe82j5m70v: hello 2024-12-18

  ```

- Agent 2: 

  ```
  2024-12-18 16:16:38	Info	System	Interval 0 period set to 5
  2024-12-18 16:16:38	Debug	System	Envelope sent to agent1qw8jn3nfl2fyyhe7v4x8pfmsge4hs9zqrqw9eq7h7hluzmd0da8z7j0uacx

  ```

 **You can now restart your agent!**

You will see a bunch of messages being displayed by `alice` which are sent by `agent_2`.

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      Whenever working with mulitple local Agents, you need a different dedicated Mailbox for each one of them!
    </Callout>

Now your Agent doesn't need to be running all the time as messages will be waiting when it comes back online.

**Great! You correctly enrolled your local Agent on the Agentverse using the Mailbox feature!**
