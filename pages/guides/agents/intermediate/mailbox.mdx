# Agent Mailboxes

## Introduction
Agents can't always be online; internet loss will cut your agent off from the network, or perhaps your agent is
behind a firewall meaning you cannot accept inbound requests. To get around online requirements we created
the
**Mailbox** feature on [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai). A Mailbox is a
middleman that acts as a mailbox for all communication to your agent. Messages are stored within the mailbox and your
agents will collect them (calls for these in [uAgents library ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/uAgents/blob/55fd0f1bd14d4d5fdaaa3dae82e4d6c6c5b9a3cd/python/src/uagents/mailbox.py#L65)) when they're online
again.

Let's get an agent using mailbox, and testing this logic. To begin we need our agents address, we use this to
register the agent on the Mailbox.

## Get your agents address

Run this simple script to get your agents address:

```py copy filename="agent_1.py"
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Model

    class Message(Model):
        message: str

    # Now your agent is ready to join the agentverse!
    agent = Agent(
        name="alice",
        seed=SEED_PHRASE,
        mailbox=f"{AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY}@https://agentverse.ai",
    )

    # Copy the address shown below
    print(f"Your agent's address is: {agent.address}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent.run()
   ```

You should get something similar within your terminal output:

    ```
    Your agent's address is: agent1qfa53drat8rzau90u4494gx5mhj3v87tm4t5cukd7gkegxcm5vx5pku7kf
    INFO:     [alice]: Registering on almanac contract...
    INFO:     [alice]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
    INFO:     [alice]: Connecting to mailbox server at agentverse.ai
    INFO:     [alice]: Mailbox access token acquired
    ```

Now that you have correctly retrieved your agent's address, let's head over to the [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai)!

## Create a Mailbox in Agentverse

Make sure that you are signed into the [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai) platform. We will now create a Mailbox for our local agent above. To do so, copy the [local agent address ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/getting-uagent-address#print-uagent-address) available within your terminal and head over to the **Agentverse: My Agents** tab. Once there, click on the **Local Agents** tab and click on **Connect Local Agent** button.

You will need to paste the **address of the local agent** you wish to retrieve and wait for confirmation. _Note that it may take some time in order for your agent to be retrieved correctly_. Make sure your agent is running on your end otherwise the agent won't be retrievable!

Once the agent is correctly retrieved, you will have to give it a **name**. When you do so and confirm, you will see a **Mailbox API Key** showing up. Copy and paste it within your local agent code by filling up the `AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY` field inline.

## updating your agent

Let's update `alice`, alice will now print to console any message she receives, provided the message has a type of
`Message`.

    ```py copy filename="agent_1.py"
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Model

    class Message(Model):
        message: str

    AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY = "put_your_AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY_here"

    # Now your agent is ready to join the agentverse!
    agent = Agent(
        name="alice",
        seed=SEED_PHRASE,
        mailbox=f"{AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY}@https://agentverse.ai",
    )

    @agent.on_message(model=Message, replies={Message})
    async def handle_message(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent.run()
   ```

## Creating an a second agent

Let's create and run a second agent to message Alice every 3 seconds:

``` python copy

from uagents import Agent, Bureau, Context, Model
from datetime import datetime

class Message(Model):
    message: str

agent_2 = Agent(name="agent_2", seed="agent_2 recovery phrase")

@agent_2.on_interval(period=3.0)
async def send_message(ctx: Context):
   await ctx.send([ALICE ADDRESS], Message(message=f"hello {datetime.datetime.now()}"))

```

## testing

With both `alice` and `agent_2` running, stop `alice` and let `agent_2` run for a further 20 seconds, or so. After
that period of time, restart `alice` and she should print out a bunch of messages from the mailbox, like so:

```
    INFO:     [alice]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
    INFO:     [alice]: Connecting to mailbox server at agentverse.ai
    INFO:     [alice]: Mailbox access token acquired
```


 **You can now restart your agent!**

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      Remember, each agent needs a different dedicated Mailbox!
    </Callout>

Now your agent doesn't need to be running all the time as messages will be waiting when it comes back online.

**Great! You correctly enrolled your local agent on the Agentverse using the Mailbox feature!**
