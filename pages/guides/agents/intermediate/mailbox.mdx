# Agent Mailboxes

Agents can communicate with other agents registered on the Fetch Network without the need to be constantly online
and without requiring your constant presence to operate. This is achieved with the Agentverse Mailbox feature. Once
you have created an agent, and generated their unique address you can use that to register a new mailbox on
agentverse. Let's do that.

      You can find additional information on the Agentverse Mailbox feature [here ↗️](/guides/agentverse/agentverse-mailbox/utilising-the-mailbox). This resource shows both the local and Agentverse agents setups to allow for a two-way communication line between these two agents.

### Local agent setup

Let's start by creating a local agent named `alice`, alice does absolutely nothing except regsitering.

    ```py copy
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Model

    class Message(Model):
        message: str

    # First generate a secure seed phrase (e.g. https://pypi.org/project/mnemonic/)
    SEED_PHRASE = "put_your_seed_phrase_here"

    # Copy the address shown below
    print(f"Your agent's address is: {Agent(seed=SEED_PHRASE).address}")

    # Then go to https://agentverse.ai, register your agent in the Mailroom
    # and copy the agent's mailbox key
    AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY = "put_your_AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY_here"

    # Now your agent is ready to join the agentverse!
    agent = Agent(
        name="alice",
        seed=SEED_PHRASE,
        mailbox=f"{AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY}@https://agentverse.ai",
    )

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent.run()
   ```


You can easily create a Mailbox by first retrieving your local agent address and head over to the **Agentverse: My Agents** tab. Here, click on **Local Agents** and click on **Connect Local Agent**. You will need to provide the address of the local agent you wish to retrieve and wait for confirmation.

You will then need to provide a **name** for the agent. Once you do so and confirm, you will see a **Mailbox API Key** showing up. Copy and paste it within your local agent code above by filling up the `AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY` field inline.

You can then restart your agent, now your agent doesn't need to run all the time as their messages will be waiting
for them for when they come back online.
