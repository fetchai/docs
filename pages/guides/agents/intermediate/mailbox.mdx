# Agent Mailboxes

## Introduction
Agents can't always be online, say for a power-cut, or simply they're only online while you are. This can be a
problem as agents should be available online as much as they can so that they do not miss any opportunities, or
contacts. However, 100% uptime is of course sometimes challenging, especially if you're hosting agents locally on
your own computer. For this reason we created
the
**Mailbox** feature on [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai). A Mailbox is a
middleman that acts as a mailbox for all communication to your agent. Messages are stored within the mailbox and your
agents will collect them (calls for these messages as in startup of uAgents library) when they're online back again.

First of all, we need to have an agent up and running locally before we can register it for a Mailbox on the Agentverse.

Let's get started!

## Local agent setup

Let's start by creating a local agent named `alice`, alice responds hello to any agent that sends a message to it, provided the message has a type of `Message`.

    ```py copy filename="agent_1.py"
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Model

    class Message(Model):
        message: str

    # First generate a secure seed phrase (e.g. https://pypi.org/project/mnemonic/)
    SEED_PHRASE = "put_your_seed_phrase_here"

    AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY = "put_your_AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY_here"

    # Now your agent is ready to join the agentverse!
    agent = Agent(
        name="alice",
        seed=SEED_PHRASE,
        mailbox=f"{AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY}@https://agentverse.ai",
    )

    # Copy the address shown below and go to https://agentverse.ai, register your agent in the Mailroom by providing the address you just copied. Then paste in within the AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY field above inline
    print(f"Your agent's address is: {agent.address}")

    @agent.on_message(model=Message, replies={Message})
    async def handle_message(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

        # send the response
        ctx.logger.info("Sending message to bob")
        await ctx.send(sender, Message(message="hello there bob"))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent.run()
   ```

We now need to create a Mailbox for this agent and retrieve a Mailbox API key which should be then pasted within your local agent code by filling up the `AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY` field.

Run the above code in your terminal to retrieve your agent's address. You will need it in the next steps to set up an Agentverse Mailbox!
When running the above agent, you should get something similar within your terminal output:

    ```
    Your agent's address is: agent1qfa53drat8rzau90u4494gx5mhj3v87tm4t5cukd7gkegxcm5vx5pku7kf
    INFO:     [alice]: Registering on almanac contract...
    INFO:     [alice]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
    INFO:     [alice]: Connecting to mailbox server at agentverse.ai
    INFO:     [alice]: Mailbox access token acquired
    ```

Now that you have correctly retrieved your agent's address, let's head over to the [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai)!

## Create a Mailbox in Agentverse

Make sure that you are signed into the [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai) platform. We will now create a Mailbox for our local agent above. To do so, copy the [local agent address ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/getting-uagent-address#print-uagent-address) available within your terminal and head over to the **Agentverse: My Agents** tab. Once there, click on the **Local Agents** tab and click on **Connect Local Agent** button.

You will need to paste the **address of the local agent** you wish to retrieve and wait for confirmation. _Note that it may take some time in order for your agent to be retrieved correctly_. Make sure your agent is running on your end otherwise the agent won't be retrievable!

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/mailbox/agentverse:mailbox/mailbox_2.png)

Once the agent is correctly retrieved, you will have to give it a **name**. When you do so and confirm, you will see a **Mailbox API Key** showing up. Copy and paste it within your local agent code by filling up the `AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY` field inline.

 **You can now restart your agent!**

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      Remember, each agent needs a different dedicated Mailbox!
    </Callout>

Now your agent doesn't need to be running all the time as messages will be waiting when it comes back online.

**Great! You correctly enrolled your local agent on the Agentverse using the Mailbox feature!**

## Next steps

Now that you have covered the setup of a local agent to be Mailbox compatible, you are ready to explore how an [Agentverse Hosted Agent ↗️](/guides/agentverse/creating-agentverse-agents/creating-a-hosted-agent) and a Local Agent communicate with one another using the Mailbox feature.

Head over to this [guide ↗️](/guides/agentverse/agentverse-mailbox/utilising-the-mailbox) to get started!
