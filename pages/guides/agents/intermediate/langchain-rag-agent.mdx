# Build a LangChain RAG Agent

## Introduction

In this guide, we'll walk through how to create agents capable of answering questions based on any provided document using the Fetch.ai uAgents and ai_engine python libraries as well as openai and cohere. The aim is to assists you in building a **LangChain Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent**!

The process of creating RAG agents has been improved by offering a decentralized and modular framework through the uAgents and ai_engine libraries. These tools streamline the integration of AI models like OpenAI and Cohere, enabling more efficient and scalable development of intelligent agents. With enhanced interoperability, security, and resource management, this framework allows developers to quickly build and deploy sophisticated agents that can effectively answer questions based on any provided document, making the entire process faster and more robust.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️"> 
      Check out the [AI Engine package ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents-ai-engine/) and [uAgents ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/) packages to download them and start integrating this tools within your Agents project!

### OpenAI API Key

1. Visit the [OpenAI website ↗️](https://openai.com/).
2. Sign up or log in to your account.
3. Navigate to the **API** section.
4. Generate or retrieve your API key.

### Cohere API Key

1. Visit the [Cohere website ↗️](https://dashboard.cohere.com/).
2. Sign up or log in to your account.
3. Go to the **API Keys** section.
4. Copy an existing key or create a new one.: one from OpenAI and one from Cohere. Follow the steps below to obtain these keys.

## Project structure and overview

### Project structure

The project is structured as follows:

    ```
    langchain-rag/
    .
    ├── poetry.lock
    ├── pyproject.toml
    └── src
        ├── agents
        │   ├── langchain_rag_agent.py
        │   └── langchain_rag_user.py
        ├── main.py
        └── messages
            └── requests.py
    ```

    The source code directory (`src`) contains the following directories and files:

        - `agents`: Contains scripts for the LangChain agents.
            - `langchain_rag_agent.py`: Script for the RAG agent (retrieves info, finds documents, generates answers).
            - langchain_rag_user.py: Script for the User agent (asks questions, handles responses).
        - `main.py`: Starts both the RAG and user agents.
        - `messages`: Defines custom message models.
            - `requests.py`: Defines the RagRequest message model (question, URL, optional deep read).

### Environment variables

You'll need to set up environment variables for your project to run correctly. These variables include your API keys, which should be stored in a `.env` file within the `src` directory.

To do this, navigate to the `src` directory. Here, create and source the `.env` file. Within this one, add the following:

    ```
    export COHERE_API_KEY="YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY"
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    ```

## Langchain RAG setup

### Project dependencies

You'll need several Python packages for the project. These can be managed efficiently using [Poetry ↗️](https://python-poetry.org/). The following dependencies are needed for the correct development of the Langchain RAG Agent project:

    ```
    [tool.poetry.dependencies]
    python = ">=3.10,<3.12"
    uagents = "*"
    requests = "^2.31.0"
    langchain = "^0.2.11"
    openai = "^1.12.0"
    langchain-openai = "^0.1.19"
    tiktoken = "^0.7.0"
    cohere = "^4.47"
    faiss-cpu = "^1.7.4"
    validators = "^0.22.0"
    uagents-ai-engine = "^0.4.0"
    unstructured = "^0.12.4"
    ```

## Messages Data Model

### RagRequest Model

We now need to define the `requests.py` file under the `messages` folder in the project. 

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
```py copy filename="mac"
touch requests.py
```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > requests.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch requests.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>
</CodeGroup>


Here, the `RagRequest` message data model represents the request to retrieve an answer to an user's question from a specified document URL. The script includes an optional parameter, `deep_read`, to determine if nested pages should also be read to retrieve the answer. This parameter is set to `no` as `default`.

The script look like the following:

    ```python copy filename="requests.py"
    from typing import Optional
    from uagents import Model, Field


    class RagRequest(Model):
        question: str = Field(
            description="The question that the user wants to have an answer for."
        )
        url: str = Field(description="The url of the docs where the answer is.")
        deep_read: Optional[str] = Field(
            description="Specifies weather all nested pages referenced from the starting URL should be read or not. The value should be yes or no.",
            default="no",
        )
    ```

    Here's a breakdown of the `RagRequest` message data Model:

        - `question (str)`: This is the user's question that needs to be answered based on the provided website URL.
        - `url (str)`: This is the URL of the website where the answer should be found.
        - `deep_read (Optional[str], default="no")`: This optional field allows you to specify whether the RAG agent should follow and read nested pages (i.e., pages linked from the starting URL). Valid values are `"yes"` or `"no"`. By `default`, the agent focuses only on the initial URL.

## Agents

### LangChain RAG Agent

This step involves setting up the **LangChain Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent** which is able to scrape web content, retrieve relevant documents, and generate answers to user queries based on that content. Let's create the file within the `agents` directory we created under `src` directory of our project and name it `langchain_rag_agent.py` by using the following command:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
```py copy filename="mac"
touch langchain_rag_agent.py
```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > langchain_rag_agent.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch langchain_rag_agent.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>
</CodeGroup>

The agent is defined as a [local agent with a Mailbox ↗️](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agents/intermediate/options-for-running-local-agents#run-a-local-agent-using-a-mailbox) and it is able to answer questions by fetching and summarizing information from a given website URL.

The script for this agent looks as follows:

    ```python copy filename="langchain_rag_agent.py"
    import traceback
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Protocol

        except Exception as exc:

    @docs_bot_protocol.on_message(model=RagRequest, replies={UAgentResponse})
    async def answer_question(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: RagRequest):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}, session: {ctx.session}")

        )


    agent.include(docs_bot_protocol, publish_manifest=True)


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent.run()
    ```

    In order to correctly run this code, you need to provide the `name`, `seed`, `mailbox`, `LANGCHAIN_RAG_SEED`, `PROMPT_TEMPLATE` and `AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY` parameters to correctly run this example.

    The agent fetches and processes information from specified URLs to answer users' questions. Let's explore the script above in more detail. Initially, multiple modules are imported, including tools for making HTTP requests, parsing HTML, and handling Natural Language Processing (NLP). The agent uses **OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model** for generating answers based on retrieved documents. We then up an agent called `langchain_rag_agent()` with a unique `seed` and `mailbox` address. Check out the [Mailbox ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/mailbox) guide for additional info on Agent Mailboxes.

    To ensure the agent has sufficient funds to operate, the `fund_agent_if_low()` function is invoked.

    Next, the `DocsBot` [protocol ↗️](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/agent-protocols) is defined using the `Protocol` class of the `uagents` library to handle message interactions. This protocol uses a predefined prompt template to structure the questions and context for the language model.

    The `create_retriever()` function is responsible for fetching and parsing web pages. If necessary, it can perform deep scraping, which involves gathering all linked pages within the same domain. The function validates URLs, retrieves HTML content, and uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and find links. The documents are then loaded and split using LangChain's `UnstructuredURLLoader`, indexed with `FAISS`, and compressed with `Cohere`, creating a retriever that can extract relevant information.

    The `answer_question()` function, decorated with the `.on_message()` [handler ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/handlers), is triggered when the agent receives a message matching the `RagRequest` message data model. The function validates the input URL and creates a retriever to fetch relevant documents based on the question. The context alongside with the question are then used to create a prompt for the language model (`ChatOpenAI`), which generates the final answer.

    The generated answer is then sent back to the user.

    Finally, the agent is set to include the `DocsBot` protocol and is then run, which starts the agent and allows it to receive and process incoming messages.

### LangChain User Agent

We are now ready to define the **LangChain User Agent** which interacts with the LangChain RAG agent defined previously to ask a question based on documents found at specified URLs. The user agent sends a request to the RAG agent to retrieve and process information from the web page and then handle the response. The agent is defined as a [local agent with an endpoint ↗️](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agents/intermediate/options-for-running-local-agents#run-a-local-agent-with-an-endpoint).

Create a file for this agent:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
```py copy filename="mac"
touch langchain_rag_user.py
```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > langchain_rag_user.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch langchain_rag_user.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>
</CodeGroup>

The script looks as follows:

    ```python copy filename="langchain_rag_user.py"
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Protocol
    from messages.requests import RagRequest
    from ai_engine import UAgentResponse
    from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

    QUESTION = "How to install uagents using pip"
    URL = "https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agents/installing-uagent"
    DEEP_READ = (
        "no"
    )

    RAG_AGENT_ADDRESS = "YOUR_LANGCHAIN_RAG_AGENT_ADDRESS"

    user = Agent(
        name="langchain_rag_user",
        port=8000,
        endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
    )
    fund_agent_if_low(user.wallet.address())
    rag_user = Protocol("LangChain RAG user")

    @rag_user.on_interval(60, messages=RagRequest)
    async def ask_question(ctx: Context):
        ctx.logger.info(
            f"Asking RAG agent to answer {QUESTION} based on document located at {URL}, reading nested pages too: {DEEP_READ}"
        )
        await ctx.send(
            RAG_AGENT_ADDRESS, RagRequest(question=QUESTION, url=URL, deep_read=DEEP_READ)
        )

    @rag_user.on_message(model=UAgentResponse)
    async def handle_data(ctx: Context, sender: str, data: UAgentResponse):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Got response from RAG agent: {data.message}")

    user.include(rag_user)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        rag_user.run()
    ```

    Remember that you need to provide the `QUESTION`, `URL`, `DEEP_READ`, `RAG_AGENT_ADDRESS`, `name`, `seed`  and `endpoint` parameters to correctly run this code.

    Here, we have created the User Agent which interacts with the LangChain RAG Agent we previously defined. The User Agent periodically asks the RAG Agent a predefined question and then handles the response.

    After importing all required modules and classes, a specific `QUESTION` is provided: `"How to install uagents using pip"`. We also provide the `URL` for the webpage where the relevant information can be found to answer the question. The `DEEP_READ` variable is set to `no` thus indicating that the agent should only read the main page and not follow and read any nested or linked pages.

    The `RAG_AGENT_ADDRESS` variable holds the address of the RAG agent, which is responsible for retrieving and processing the webpage content to answer the user's question.

    We are now ready to define the User Agent. We create the `langchain_rag_user` is created with a specific `port` and `endpoint`, which is where it will communicate with the RAG Agent. The agent's wallet is funded if needed using the `fund_agent_if_low()` function.

    We then proceed and define the [protocol ↗️](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/agent-protocols). A protocol named `LangChain RAG user` is defined using the `Protocol` class of the `uagents` library to handle the agent's interactions. This protocol contains two important functions:

        1. The `ask_question()` function is decorated with the `.on_interval()` [handler ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/handlers) and it is set to run at 60-second intervals. This function sends a `RagRequest` message to the LangChain RAG agent, asking it to answer the `QUESTION` based on the specified `URL`. It then logs the `QUESTION` and `URL` details for debugging purposes.
        2. The `handle_data()` function is decorated with the `.on_message()` handler and it handles incoming messages from the LangChain RAG agent. When a response is received, it logs the response message.

Finally, the LangChain RAG user protocol is then included using the `.include()` method into the agent which is then run by calling `rag_user.run()` in the main block.

## Main script

We are now ready to define the main script for our project. In the `src` folder of our project we create a Python script named `main.py` using the following command:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
```py copy filename="mac"
touch main.py
```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > main.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch main.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>
</CodeGroup>

We then define the code within this one which looks like the one provided here below:

    ```python copy filename="main.py"
    from uagents import Bureau
    from agents.langchain_rag_agent import agent
    from agents.langchain_rag_user import user

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        bureau = Bureau(endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit", port=8000)
        print(f"Adding RAG agent to Bureau: {agent.address}")
        bureau.add(agent)
        print(f"Adding user agent to Bureau: {user.address}")
        bureau.add(user)
        bureau.run()
    ```

Now, both of agents are set up, and you will need to **connect your local agents to the Agentverse** so for them to be retrievable for communication and interaction with any other registered agent on the Fetch Network. This way, the `langchain_rag_agent` will be connected to the Agentverse using a [Mailbox ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/mailbox) and afterward a [Agent Function ↗️](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-functions) will be created and [registered ↗️](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agentverse/agentverse-functions/registering-agent-services) for this agent.

The `langchain_rag_user` agent is used as a testing agent for the RAG agent being registered on the Agentverse and made subsequently available on DeltaV for queries.

      Head over to the following [guide ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/options-for-running-local-agents#run-a-local-agent-using-a-mailbox) for a better understanding of local agent registration on the Agentverse.
    </Callout>

### Expected output

The expected output for this example should be similar to the following one where we questioned the **RAG Agent** with the question `How to install uagents using pip` from the **RAG user** agent:
