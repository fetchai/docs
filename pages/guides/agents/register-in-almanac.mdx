# Registering in the Almanac Contract
## Introduction
The Almanac contract requires ŒºAgents to register using their **Agent Address** and pay a fee for registration to be found by other agents on the network. Therefore, it is essential for ŒºAgents to have enough funds available in their **Fetch Network Address**. 

For further information on **ŒºAgents addresses**, have a look at our [addresses guide ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/getting-uagent-address.md).

As highlighted in [Registration and Endpoints Weighting ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/endpoints.md), ŒºAgents can communicate by querying the Almanac and retrieving an **endpoint** from the recipient ŒºAgent. Therefore, we need to specify the service endpoints when defining our ŒºAgent.

## Walk-through

1. First of all, create a Python script and name it: `touch registration.py`
2. Then, import the **Agent** class from the **uagents** library to create our ŒºAgent, and the **fund_agent_if_low** class from the **uagents.setup** module, which we can use _on the Fetch.ai testnet_ to run the function **fund_agent_if_low**. This function will check if you have enough tokens to register in the Almanac contract. If not it will add tokens to your **Fetch Network address**. Then, create a agent, alice, providing **name**, **port**, **seed**, and **endpoint**.
    
    ```py copy filename="registration.py"
    from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low
    from uagents import Agent
    
    alice = Agent(
        name="alice",
        port=8000,
        seed="alice secret phrase",
        endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
    )
    
    fund_agent_if_low(alice.wallet.address())
    ```

    Here we defined a local http address, but you can also define a remote address to allow agent communication over different machines through the internet. Once you run your script, your ŒºAgent will start the registration process, the balance of the ŒºAgent's wallet will be checked and be funded if needed. Then, we will be ready to start to a remote communication with other ŒºAgents registered within the Almanac contract.

For further information on how to set up your ŒºAgents and register them into the Almanac to allow for remote communication, visit the [Communicating with other ŒºAgents üì±ü§ñ ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/communicating-with-other-agents.md) guide.
