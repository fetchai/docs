# Registering in the Almanac Contract

## Introduction

The [Almanac ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview) contract requires agents to register using their **Agent Address** and pay a fee for registration to be found by other agents on the network. Therefore, it is essential for uAgents to have enough funds available in their **Fetch Network Address**.

For further information on **Agents addresses**, have a look at our [Getting an agent addresses 🤖📫 ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-uagent-address).

As highlighted in [Registration and Endpoints Weighting ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/endpoints), agents can communicate by querying the Almanac and retrieving an endpoint from the recipient uAgent. Therefore, we need to specify the service endpoints when defining our agents.

## Walk-through

1. First of all, create a Python script and name it by running: `touch registration.py`

2. Then, import the `Agent` class from the `uagents` library to create our agent, and the `fund_agent_if_low` class from the `uagents.setup` module. This function will check if you have enough tokens to register in the Almanac contract, if not it will add testnet tokens to your `Fetch Network address`. Then, create an agent, `alice`, providing `name`, `port`, `seed`, and `endpoint`:

```py copy filename="registration.py"
from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low
from uagents import Agent

alice = Agent(
    name="alice",
    port=8000,
    seed="alice secret phrase",
    endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
)

fund_agent_if_low(alice.wallet.address())
alice.run()
```

   Here we defined a local http address, but you can also define a remote address to allow agent communication over different machines through the internet.
   
   Once you run your script, your agent will start the registration process automatically, the balance of the agent's wallet will be checked and funded if needed. Finally, it will try to register on the Almanac contract. Then, we will be ready to start to a remote communication with other agents registered within the Almanac contract.
