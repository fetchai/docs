# Agents - uAgents Framework

## Introduction

The **uAgents Framework** is a lightweight library designed to facilitate the development of decentralized **Agents**. Agents in a multi-agent system can communicate with any, and all agents in the system to solve problems, execute tasks and transact.

      Head over to the [uagents package ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/) to download it and start developing your Agents!

      Current version of the uAgents package is <PackageVersion packageName="uagents" packageType="pypi" />.

Agents built with the uAgents Framework are autonomous programs designed for decentralized interactions, with decentralization being optional. They can transform systems like supply chains by enhancing forecasting, logistics, supplier monitoring, and risk management, driving efficiency and accuracy. Developers can leverage these Agents to build intelligent, self-managed systems across various domains.

## Why Agents

With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-driven tools, autonomous Agents are revolutionizing problem-solving, decision-making, and collaboration.

For instance, Agents operating in the financial sector are able to automate trading, risk assessment, fraud detection, and customer support. By leveraging predictive analytics, they analyze market trends, assess risks, and offer tailored advice. Continuous transaction monitoring enhances security and simplifies processes, providing valuable insights for better decision-making.

Fetch.ai's uAgents Framework enables developers to create customizable Agents for decentralized networks, tailored to specific tasks and real-world challenges. These autonomous systems, powered by the Fetch network and the [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro), collaborate to streamline tasks, solve complex problems, and improve decision-making across industries.
