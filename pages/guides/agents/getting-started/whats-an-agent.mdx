# Agents - uAgents Framework

## Introduction

The **uAgents Framework** is a lightweight library designed to facilitate the development of decentralized **Agents**. Agents in a multi-agent system can communicate with any, and all agents in the system to solve problems, execute tasks and transact.

      Head over to the [uagents package ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/) to download it and start developing your Agents!

      Current version of the uAgents package is <PackageVersion packageName="uagents" packageType="pypi" />.

Agents, built with the uAgents Framework, are autonomous software programs capable of interacting with others in a decentralized environment. While decentralization is supported, it remains optional based on user needs.

Intelligent Agents can revolutionize complex systems. For instance, in supply chain management, Agents can enhance demand forecasting, inventory control, logistics optimization, supplier monitoring, quality control, and risk mitigation. This leads to improved efficiency, cost reduction, accuracy, and real-time visibility.

These Agents are the foundation for developers to leverage the uAgents Framework, enabling the creation of intelligent, self-managed systems across various domains.

## Why Agents

With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-driven products, autonomous Agents bridge the gap between these tools, transforming how we solve problems, make decisions, and collaborate.

For instance, within the financial sector, Agents can automate trading, risk assessment, fraud detection, and customer support operations. By leveraging predictive analytics, they can analyze market trends, assess risks for loans and investments, and potentially offer tailored financial advice. Agents can also enhance security by detecting fraud through continuous transaction monitoring. This simplifies processes, provides valuable insights, and supports better decision-making for both financial institutions and investors.

Fetch.ai's uAgents Framework empowers developers to create Agents that can join a decentralized network to tackle real-world challenges. Developers can customize Agents behavior to perform precise tasks tailored to specific use cases.

The concept of Agents refers to autonomous, decentralized systems that overcome conventional limitations. Agents provide a gateway to a future where intelligent Agents, empowered by the Fetch network and the [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro), can communicate, negotiate and collaborate to streamline complex tasks, solve complex problems and improve decision-making processes in various fields.
