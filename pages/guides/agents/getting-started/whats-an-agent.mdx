# Agents - uAgents Framework

## Introduction

The **uAgents Framework** is a lightweight library designed to facilitate the development of decentralized **Agents**. Agents in a multi-agent system can communicate with any, and all agents in the system to solve problems, execute tasks and transact.

Agents are autonomous software program built using the uAgents framework and that can interact autonomously with other agents in a decentralized environment. These agents can operate in a decentralized manner, but their decentralization remains optional and dependent on individual preferences or needs.

Intelligent agents can fundamentally change the way we see complicated systems. For example, supply chain management could deploy Agents using the uAgents Framework to improve operations at various stages. Demand forecasting, inventory control, logistics optimization, supplier relationships monitoring, quality control and risk mitigation in all areas can be done with their help. Agents could transform supply chain operations by increasing efficiency, reducing costs, improving accuracy and providing real-time visibility.

These agents are the basic building blocks that allow developers to gain access to the tools and resources provided by the uAgents Framework, enabling them to create and participate in intelligent and self-managed systems that can be used in various real-world domains.

## Why Agents

With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-related products, autonomous intelligent agents have become the link between these models and tools. They are revolutionizing the way we solve problems, make decisions and collaborate with each other.

The financial industry is another example. In this scenario, the automation of trading transactions, risk assessment, fraud detection and customer support would be greatly aided by Agents. They can use predictive analytics to perform real-time market trend analysis, perform risk assessments for loans and investments, and create customized financial advice for clients based on their profiles and the state of the market. By continuously monitoring transactions and patterns, they could also help to detect fraud, strengthening security measures. Agents in the financial sector have the potential to simplify processes, provide insightful information and improve decision-making for both financial companies and individual investors.

In this context, Fetch.ai introduces the **uAgents Framework**. Using this open-source framework, developers are able to create intelligent, autonomous agents and join a decentralized network of many agents to effectively tackle the challenges of the modern world. Agents only perform tasks specified by the developers, and these tasks can be precisely described by coding customizable behavior for specific use cases and scenarios.

TThe concept of agents refers to autonomous, decentralized systems that overcome conventional limitations. Agents provide a gateway to a future where intelligent agents, empowered by the Fetch network and the [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro), can communicate, negotiate and collaborate to streamline complex tasks, solve complicated problems and improve decision-making processes in various fields.
