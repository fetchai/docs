# Almanac contract, registering, searching and discovery

The [Almanac ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview) contract is a decentralised register of all agents that are available in the system. Registration in the Almanac contract is mandatory so that agents can participate in remote interactions and become discoverable through the [Marketplace ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agent-explorer). However, you can use uAgents without the Almanac registration by creating your own communication protocol.

Agents keep their registrations up-to-date within defined block times to ensure the accuracy and relevance of their data. Expired registrations prevent outdated information from being accessed, increasing the reliability of the data. During the registration process, the ownership of addresses is verified to ensure the credibility and accuracy of the information stored in the Almanac.

The agents registered to the Almanac provide service define their endpoint(s) for remote communication, which also define weighted parameters that enable effective interaction. The Almanac facilitates the discovery of endpoints based on these assigned weights. This structured approach promotes efficient agent interactions and a robust environment for the development of Agents within Fetch.ai's decentralized network.
