# Getting Started with FET Token for Agent development

## Introduction

The FET token was created to facilitate payments in an Agentic ecosystem, these are micro payments to one another which traditional currencies do not support. FET tokens are used for agent Almanac registration, and wider contract interactions. 

## Acquiring FET Tokens

Exchanges are the simplest way to get FET tokens.

Visit a trusted exchange such as Coinbase or Binance. You may need to create an account, which will involve you
passing [KYC ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/know-your-customer-guidance/know-your-customer-guidance-accessible-version). Once your account is enabled, you can buy FET token. You can buy this with most global
currencies, just check on the exchange which currencies they accept.

## Storing FET

Ideally you would be sending this FET to your agent to transact on the network. However, if you'd like greater
security or accessibility.

For short-term storage goals, the ASI Wallet is an excellent choice; it provides direct functionalities for daily activities such as staking and interacting with Agents.

For long-term storage goals, you can enhance security by integrating your ASI Wallet with a hardware wallet like Ledger, offering robust protection for your assets. Follow this guide [here ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/fetch-network/asi-wallet/asi-wallet-hardware-connection-guide) if you wish to set up the ASI Alliance extension wallet with a Ledger hardware wallet.

## How to transfer tokens to your Agents

You can download and use the uAgents library to create autonomous Agents capable of interacting with other Agents in a decentralized environment. Check out this guide [here ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/getting-started/installing-uagent) to get started with Agents development.

In order to get your Agent up and running within the ASI Ecosystem, you will need to retrieve the Agent's address and fund it with FET tokens to make it correctly register within the network.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      When creating your account, it is crucial to securely store your [seed phrase ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/getting-started/seedphrase). The seed phrase is essential for accessing your Agent's identity and controlling any funds it holds. Treat it with the highest level of security to prevent unauthorized access!

### Getting your Agent address to send tokens to your Agent

The following Python script demonstrates how to create and initialize an Agent using the `uagents` and `cosmpy` libraries, to connect it to the Fetch.ai Mainnet, and retrieve its address and balance information:

    ```py copy filename="agent_address_and_balance.py"
    from uagents import Agent, Context
    import cosmpy

    from cosmpy.aerial.client import LedgerClient, NetworkConfig

    agent = Agent(name="alice", seed="", port=8000, test=False,  endpoint=["http://localhost:8000/submit"])

    @agent.on_event("startup")
    async def introduce_agent(ctx: Context):
        ctx.logger.info(f"ASI network address:{agent.wallet.address()}")
        ledger_client = LedgerClient(NetworkConfig.fetch_mainnet())
        address: str = agent.wallet.address()
        balances = ledger_client.query_bank_all_balances(address)
        ctx.logger.info(f"Balance of addr: {balances}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent.run()

    ```

**You must update the seed value, and store it safely. Losing this value will lose you your tokens.**

In the code example above an Agent named `alice` is initialized with a specified `name`, `port`, `endpoint`, and `seed`
parameters. When the Agent starts up, it logs the wallet address and queries the balance using the `LedgerClient` connected to the Fetch.ai Mainnet. Finally, the script runs the Agent, which processes the `startup` event and retrieves the balance, allowing the Agent to interact with the Fetch.ai network.

Once you run the above Agent script, you will see your Agent address and balance printed out. You will see something similar to the following output:

    ```
    INFO:     [alice]: Registration on Almanac API successful
    INFO:     [alice]: Registering on almanac contract...
    INFO:     [alice]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
    INFO:     [alice]: Agent inspector available at https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8000&address=agent1qdxdrwqek4pt9xt8kggcxus0zm54d4vgdznrs6y5acn26paphervwfj7pdd
    INFO:     [alice]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    INFO:     [alice]: ASI network address:fetch1ujr7wyuvza7uwnkr3usv53hjlwjvu8s7l06vzf
    INFO:     [alice]: Balance of addr: []
    ```

You can now use this address to transfer your purchased FET tokens from the exchange to this Agent's address. This
should be as simple as withdrawing native FET, by selecting the Fetch.ai Mainnet network when withdrawing. Some
exchanges do not support Native FET, and you will need to use the [token bridge](https://token-bridge.fetch.ai/),
luckily we have [a guide for that too](/guides/fetch-network/how-to-convert-fet-to-and-from-erc20)
