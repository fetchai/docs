# Creating your first agent 🤖🧑‍💻


## Introduction

Once you've [installed ↗️](/guides/agents/installing-uagent) the uAgents library, it's quite simple to get a minimal use case running. Let our first agent be a simple initialisation and printing out the agent's name.

### The agent

1. Let's create a Python script for this task, and name it by running: `touch agent.py`

2. We then need to import the `Agent` and `Context` classes from the `uagents` library, and then create an agent using the class `Agent`:

   ```py copy
   from uagents import Agent, Context
   agent = Agent(name="alice", seed="secret_seed_phrase")
   ```

   It is optional but useful to include a `seed` parameter when creating an agent to set fixed [addresses ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-uagent-address). Otherwise, random addresses will be generated every time you run the agent. Your address is kind of important, as this is how other agents will identify you.

3. Let's define a `say_hello()` function for our agent to print a message periodically saying `hello, my name is ...`:

   ```py copy
   @agent.on_event("startup")
   async def introduce_agent(ctx: Context):
       ctx.logger.info(f"Hello, I'm agent {agent.name} and my address is {agent.address}.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       agent.run()
   ```

   The `.on_event("startup")` decorator defines a behavior for this agent when it is run. In this case, the agent will execute the `say_hello()` function when the agent starts. The `Context` object is a collection of data and functions related to the agent. In this case, we just use the agent's `name`, `alice`. The agent executes the function and uses the `ctx.logger.info()` method to print the message.

4. Save the script.

The overall script should look as follows:

```py copy filename="agent.py"
from uagents import Agent, Context

agent = Agent(name="alice", seed="secret_seed_phrase")

@agent.on_event("startup")
async def introduce_agent(ctx: Context):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Hello, I'm agent {agent.name} and my address is {agent.address}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent.run()
```

### Run your agent

Make sure to have activated your virtual environment correctly.

Run the script: `python agent.py`

The output would be:

    ```
    [alice]: Hello, I'm agent alice and my address is <agent_address>
    ```

**Congratulations, you have just created your first Agent!**
