# Creating your first agent

## Introduction

Once you've [installed ↗️](/guides/agents/installing-uagent) the uAgents library, it's quite simple to get a minimal use case running.

The uAgents Framework streamlines agent creation by offering tools for communication, discovery, and publication within the Fetch.ai network. It empowers users and developers with flexibility, allowing them to build agents using anything from cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) to simple APIs.

Let our first agent be a simple initialization and printing out the agent's name and address.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have read the following resources before going on with this guide:

  - [Quick Start Guide for uAgents Framework ↗️](/guides/agents/quickstart)
  - [Agents address ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/getting-uagent-address)

## Imports needed

  - [uAgents ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/)

### The agent

1. Let's create a Python script for this task, and name it by running:

    <CodeGroup isOSFile>

        ```py copy filename="mac"
        touch agent.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="windows"
        echo. > agent.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
        touch agent.py
        ```

    </CodeGroup>

2. We then need to import the `Agent` and `Context` classes from the `uagents` library, and then create an agent using the class `Agent`:

   ```py copy
   from uagents import Agent, Context
   agent = Agent(name="alice", seed="secret_seed_phrase")
   ```

   It is optional but useful to include a `seed` parameter when creating an agent to set fixed [addresses ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-uagent-address). Otherwise, random addresses will be generated every time you run the agent. Your address is kind of important, as this is how other agents will identify you.

3. Let's define a `say_hello()` function for our agent to print a message periodically saying `hello, my name is ...`:

   ```py copy
   @agent.on_event("startup")
   async def introduce_agent(ctx: Context):
       ctx.logger.info(f"Hello, I'm agent {agent.name} and my address is {agent.address}.")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       agent.run()
   ```

   The `.on_event("startup")` decorator defines a behavior for this agent when it is run. In this case, the agent will execute the `say_hello()` function when the agent starts. The `Context` object is a collection of data and functions related to the agent. In this case, we just use the agent's `name`, `alice`. The agent executes the function and uses the `ctx.logger.info()` method to print the message.

4. Save the script.

The overall script should look as follows:

```py copy filename="agent.py"
from uagents import Agent, Context

agent = Agent(name="alice", seed="secret_seed_phrase")

@agent.on_event("startup")
async def introduce_agent(ctx: Context):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Hello, I'm agent {agent.name} and my address is {agent.address}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent.run()
```

### Run your agent

Make sure to have activated your virtual environment correctly.

Run the script: `python agent.py`

The output would be:

    ```
    INFO:     [alice]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    INFO:     [alice]: Hello, I'm agent alice and my address is <agent_address>
    ```

**Congratulations, you have just created your first Agent!**
