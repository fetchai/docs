# Creating your first agent ü§ñüßë‚Äçüíª


## Introduction

Once you've [installed ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/installing-uagent) the uAgents library, it's quite simple to get a minimal use case running. Let our first agent be a simple inialisation and printing out the agent's name.

### The agent

1. Let's create a Python script for this task, and name it by running: `touch agent.py`

2. We then need to import the `Agent` and `Context` classes from the `uagents` library, and then create an agent using the class `Agent`:

   ```py copy
   from uagents import Agent, Context
   alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")
   ```

   It is optional but useful to include a `seed` parameter when creating an agent to set fixed [addresses ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/getting-uagent-address)Ô∏è. Otherwise, random addresses will be generated every time you run the agent. Your address is kind of important, as this is how other agents will identify you.

3. Let's define a `say_hello()` function for our agent to print a message periodically saying `hello, my name is ...`:

   ```py copy
   @alice.on_event("startup")
   async def say_hello(ctx: Context):
       ctx.logger.info(f'hello, my name is {ctx.name}')

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       alice.run()
   ```

   The `.on_event("startup")` decorator defines a behavior for this agent when it is run. In this case, the agent will execute the `say_hello()` function when the agent starts. The `Context` object is a collection of data and functions related to the agent. In this case, we just use the agent's `name`, `alice`. The agent executes the function and uses the `ctx.logger.info()` method to print the message.

4. Save the script.

The overall script should look as follows:

```py copy filename="agent.py"
from uagents import Agent, Context

alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")

@alice.on_event("startup")
async def say_hello(ctx: Context):
    ctx.logger.info(f'hello, my name is {ctx.name}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    alice.run()
```

### Run your agent

Make sure to have activated your virtual environment correctly.

Run the script: `python agent.py`

The output would be:

    ```
    [alice]: hello, my name is alice
    ```

**Congratulations, you have just created your first Agent!**
