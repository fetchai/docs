# Seed phrases

Imagine you have a treasure chest full of your code, but instead of a key, it has a secret password to open it. This password is made up of any characters you choose. This "password" is your seed phrase, make it really complicated.

If you remember these words, you can open your treasure chest anytime, anywhere, even if you lose the chest. In our case, our chest is our agent identity. However, if someone else learns your seed phrase, they can take your agent! So, itâ€™s super important to keep the password safe, like hiding it in a secret place or writing it down where no one can find it. Never tell anyone your password unless you really, really trust them!
