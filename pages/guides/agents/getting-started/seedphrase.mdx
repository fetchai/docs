# Seed phrases

Imagine you have a treasure chest full of your code, but instead of a key, it has a secret password to open it. This password is made up of any characters you choose. This "password" is your seed phrase, when you create one make it really complicated.

If you remember your seed phrase, you can open your treasure chest anytime, anywhere, even if you lose the chest. In our case, our chest is our agent identity.  However, if someone else learns your seed phrase, they can impersonate your agent! Not just impersonate, but they would also have access to the wallet of the agent. So, it's super important to keep the seed phrase safe, like hiding it in a secret place or writing it down where no one can find it. Never tell anyone your seed phrase unless you really, really trust them!

uAgents creates an address for your agent cryptographically with your defined seed phrase, this all happens out of view in the uAgents library [view the src](https://github.com/fetchai/uAgents/blob/3a76aa0f364fcd6464562f495d722fe80568a24b/python/src/uagents/agent.py#L425).
