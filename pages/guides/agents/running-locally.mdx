i# Running locally

Sometimes you'll want to run an agent on your own hardware or infrastructure; luckily this is very easy to do on any system that support Python 3.10

## Introduction

With a birds eye view, your agent will live on a device of your choice. On startup it will register to the Almanc, and then be available to communicate with other agents. To get this agent to be DeltaV accessible,  we will go to agentverse to create a new service for the agent, to then allow this agent to be found in DeltaV.


## Here's the agent:

```py copy filename="agent.py"
from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low
from uagents import Agent, Context, Protocol, Model
import random
from pydantic import Field
from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType
import sys

dicey = Agent(
    name="dungeonsanddragonsdiceroll",
    port=6145,
    seed="docs is making a remote agent",
    endpoint=["http://hello.world:6145/submit"],
)

fund_agent_if_low(dicey.wallet.address())


@dicey.on_event("startup")
async def whats_my_address(ctx: Context):
    ctx.logger.info(dicey.address)


class Request(Model):
    msg: str = Field(description="String msg of the request for dice roll.")


dice_roll_protocol = Protocol("DungeonsAndDragonsDiceRoll")


@dice_roll_protocol.on_message(model=DiceRoll, replies={UAgentResponse})
async def roll_dice(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: DiceRoll):
    result = str(random.randint(1, 12))
    message = f"Dice roll results: {result}"
    await ctx.send(
        sender, UAgentResponse(message=message, type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL)
    )


dicey.include(dice_roll_protocol, publish_manifest=True)

dicey.run()
 ```

A few things to note; you'll need to be running this agent on infrastructure that allows you to open a port, in our example we run on port `6145`.

The agent is initalised with an endpoint, and a port - this is so we can receive messages, and other agents know where to send them. We call `fund_agent_if_low` to get some funds, if we need them. And we define our ptotocol, which is just a string `Request`.

Our `on_message` doesn't do much other than return a number between 1 and 12 inclusive. However, this is of type  `UAgentResponse` which is essential to communicate with DeltaV.

`.run()` initialises the agent.

Finally, we  run our agent as follows: `python agent.py`
