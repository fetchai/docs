# Agents address ü§ñüì´

## Introduction

Each agent within the Fetch ecosystem is characterized by different addresses. These can allow the agent to perform different actions, including sending messages or interacting with the [Almanac contract ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview).

It is possible to distinguish between two different types of addresses:

    - `uAgent address`: this is the main agent identifier. Other agents can use this address to query the agent's information in the Almanac contract.

    - `Fetch network address`: this is the address providing the agent with the capabilities for interacting with the [Fetch Ledger ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/intro), including [Registration in the Almanac ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/register-in-almanac) contract.

If you want to retrieve the address of your agent, you can either use the `print()` function and specify which of the above addresses you wish to print out, or by calling the `Context` class and related methods to retrieve specific information.

**Let's now check how these ways of retrieving addresses look like!**

## Print uAgent address

You can print the `uAgent address` related to your agent in the following way:

1. First of all, create a Python script and name it by running: `touch uagent-address.py`

2. We then need to import the `Agent` class from the `uagents` library to create an agent, `alice`. Then, using the `print` function, we will print the related `uAgent address`. Importantly, remember that the `seed` parameter is used, when creating an agent, to set fixed addresses, otherwise a random address will be generated every time you run the agent:

   ```py copy filename="uagent-address.py"
   from uagents import Agent

   alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")

   print("uAgent address: ", alice.address)
   ```

3. Save the script.

The output would be as follows:

    ```
    uAgent address: agent1qww3ju3h6kfcuqf54gkghvt2pqe8qp97a7nzm2vp8plfxflc0epzcjsv79t
    ```

## Print Fetch network address

You can print the `Fetch network address` related to your agent in the following way:

1. Let's create a Python script, and name it by running: `touch fetch-address.py`

2. As before, we first need to import the `Agent` class from the `uagents` library to create a uAgent, `alice`. Then, using the `print()` function, we will print the related `Fetch Network address`:

   ```py copy filename="fetch-address.py"
   from uagents import Agent

   alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")

   print("Fetch network address: ", alice.wallet.address())
   ```

3. Save the script.

The output would be as follows:

    ```
    Fetch network address: fetch1454hu0n9eszzg8p7mvan3ep7484jxl5mkf9phg
    ```

## Print agent name and address using `Context` class

In this guide, we aim at showing how to create an agent being able to say hello and printing its `name` and `address` retrieving such information from the `Context` class imported from the `uagents` library.

The `Context` class is a crucial component which represents the execution context of an agent. It encapsulates different attributes and methods which allow an agent to interact with its environment, send and receive messages, and manage its state and identity. Within this class, we can distinguish multiple attributes and methods, including:

    - `name`: which returns the provided name of the agent, if specified, otherwise, if the agent's name is not explicitly set, then it will use the first ten characters of the agent's address as its name.

    - `address`: which returns the unique address of the agent in the form `agent1...`. This address is essential for other agents to interact with your agent.

**Let's get started and use the `Context` class to make our agent print its name and address!**

### Walk-through

1. First of all, you need to create a Python script and name it by running: `touch my_agent.py`

2. We then need to import the necessary classes `Agent` and `Context` from the `uagents` library, and then create an instance of the `Agent` class, `alice`:

   ```py copy
   from uagents import Agent, Context

   alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")
   ```

3. We would then need to assign the agent the behavior to be executed. In this case, `alice` could send a message when it is being run saying hello and printing its `name` and `address`:

   ```py copy
   @alice.on_event("startup")
   async def introduce_agent(ctx: Context):
       ctx.logger.info(f"Hello, I'm agent {ctx.name} and my address is {ctx.address}.")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        alice.run()
   ```

   This `introduce_agent()` function takes a single argument `ctx` of type `Context`. The message is printed out using the `ctx.logger.info()` method, and includes the agent's name obtained from attribute `name` of the `Context` class and retrieved using `ctx.name()` method. The same for the agent's address, which is obtained from attribute `address` of the `Context` class and retrieved using `ctx.address()` method.

4. Save the script.

The overall script should look as follows:

```py copy filename="my_agent.py"
from uagents import Agent, Context

alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")

@alice.on_event("startup")
async def introduce_agent(ctx: Context):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Hello, I'm agent {ctx.name} and my address is {ctx.address}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    alice.run()
```

### Run the script

On your terminal, make sure to have activated the virtual environment.

Run the script: `my_agent.py`

The output should be as follows:

    ```
    Hello, I'm agent alice and my address is agent1qww3ju3h6kfcuqf54gkghvt2pqe8qp97a7nzm2vp8plfxflc0epzcjsv79t.
    ```
