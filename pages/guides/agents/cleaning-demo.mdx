# How to use the uAgents to simulate a cleaning scenario âœ¨

## Introduction

In this guide we will show how to set up protocols and different uAgents to implement a cleaning service between clients and cleaning service providers using the `uagents` library.

## Walk-through

1. First of all, you need to navigate towards the directory you created for your project and create a folder for this task: `mkdir cleaning_demo`.
2. Inside this folder we will create another folder for our protocols: `mkdir protocols`.
3. Within the `protocols` folder, let's create a sub-folder: `mkdir cleaning`. This is the folder including all of the scripts for our cleaning protocol to run correctly.
4. After having defined our protocols folder, we need to create 2 scripts, one for our **user** and the other one for **cleaner** uAgents.

We can start by writing the code for our protocol.

### Cleaning Protocol

The Cleaning Protocol is made up of two scripts: `__init__.py` and `models.py`.

#### Models

First, we need to define a `models` protocol which defines the structure and relationships of users, service types, providers, and availability within the cleaning service application. The defined models and their relationships will be used for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation throughout the application's logic.

1.  First of all, navigate towards the cleaning directory and create a Python script for this task and name it by running: `touch models.py`
2.  We then import the necessary classes from `enum` and `tortoise` libraries, and then define the different data models:

    ```py copy filename="models.py"
    from enum import Enum

    from tortoise import fields, models

    class ServiceType(int, Enum):
        FLOOR = 1
        WINDOW = 2
        LAUNDRY = 3
        IRON = 4
        BATHROOM = 5

    class User(models.Model):
        id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
        name = fields.CharField(max_length=64)
        address = fields.CharField(max_length=100)
        created_at = fields.DatetimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    class Service(models.Model):
        id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
        type = fields.IntEnumField(ServiceType)

    class Provider(models.Model):
        id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
        name = fields.CharField(max_length=64)
        location = fields.CharField(max_length=64)
        created_at = fields.DatetimeField(auto_now_add=True)
        availability = fields.ReverseRelation["Availability"]
        services = fields.ManyToManyField("models.Service")
        markup = fields.FloatField(default=1.1)

    class Availability(models.Model):
        id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
        provider = fields.OneToOneField("models.Provider", related_name="availability")
        max_distance = fields.IntField(default=10)
        time_start = fields.DatetimeField()
        time_end = fields.DatetimeField()
        min_hourly_price = fields.FloatField(default=0.0)
    ```

    We defined the following data models:

        - `ServiceType` is an enumeration class that defines different types of cleaning services. Each service type is associated with an integer value. Service types include `FLOOR`, `WINDOW`, `LAUNDRY`, `IRON`, and `BATHROOM`.

        - `User` is a model representing the users of the cleaning service. It takes in the following fields:
                - `id`: Auto-incrementing integer field serving as the primary key.
                - `name`: Character field with a maximum length of 64 for the user's name.
                - `address`: Character field with a maximum length of 100 for the user's address.
                - `created_at`: DateTime field automatically set to the current timestamp when the user is created.

        - `Service` is model representing types of cleaning services. It takes in the following fields:
                - `id`: Auto-incrementing integer field serving as the primary key.
                - `type`: Enum field storing the ServiceType enumeration values.

        - `Provider` is a model representing cleaning service providers. It considers the following fields:
                - `id`: Auto-incrementing integer field serving as the primary key.
                - `name`: Character field with a maximum length of 64 for the provider's name.
                - `location`: Character field with a maximum length of 64 for the provider's location.
                - `created_at`: DateTime field automatically set to the current timestamp when the provider is created.
                - `availability`: Reverse relation to the `Availability` model.
                - `services`: Many-to-many relationship with the `Service` model.
                - `markup`: Float field representing the markup applied to service prices.

        - `Availability` is a model representing the availability of a cleaning service provider. It considers the following fields:
                - `id`: Auto-incrementing integer field serving as the primary key.
                - `provider`: One-to-one relationship to the `Provider` model.
                - `max_distance`: Integer field representing the maximum distance a provider can travel for services.
                - `time_start`: DateTime field indicating the start time of availability.
                - `time_end`: DateTime field indicating the end time of availability.
                - `min_hourly_price`: Float field representing the minimum hourly price for services.

3.  Save the script.

Now that we have defined the protocols for this application, we proceed by defining the user and cleaner agents.

#### **init**

Now let's define a protocol handling communication between a user requesting a cleaning service and a cleaning service provider.

1.  Inside the cleaning directory, create a Python script for this task and name it by running: `touch __init__.py`

2.  Let's import the necessary classes from `datetime`, `typing`, `geopy.geocoders`, `geopy.distance`, `uagents`, and `.models`. Let's then define the message models and handlers for the service request, service response, service booking, and booking response using the `uagents` library. We then proceed and create a cleaning_proto object using the uagents **Protocol** class. We give it the name `cleaning` and the version `0.1.0`. This protocol will be used to define handlers and manage communication between agents using the defined message models:

    ```py copy
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    from typing import List

    from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
    from geopy.distance import geodesic

    from uagents import Context, Model, Protocol
    from .models import Provider, Availability, User

    PROTOCOL_NAME = "cleaning"
    PROTOCOL_VERSION = "0.1.0"

    class ServiceRequest(Model):
        user: str
        location: str
        time_start: datetime
        duration: timedelta
        services: List[int]
        max_price: float

    class ServiceResponse(Model):
        accept: bool
        price: float

    class ServiceBooking(Model):
        location: str
        time_start: datetime
        duration: timedelta
        services: List[int]
        price: float

    class BookingResponse(Model):
        success: bool

    cleaning_proto = Protocol(name=PROTOCOL_NAME, version=PROTOCOL_VERSION)
    ```

3.  We would then need to define an `in_service_region` function, which determines whether a user's location is within the service area of a cleaning service provider. This function uses the `geopy` library for geolocation-related calculations and comparisons:

    ```py copy
    def in_service_region(
        location: str, availability: Availability, provider: Provider
    ) -> bool:
        geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="micro_agents")

        user_location = geolocator.geocode(location)
        cleaner_location = geolocator.geocode(provider.location)

        if user_location is None:
            raise RuntimeError(f"user location {location} not found")

        if cleaner_location is None:
            raise RuntimeError(f"provider location {provider.location} not found")

        cleaner_coordinates = (cleaner_location.latitude, cleaner_location.longitude)
        user_coordinates = (user_location.latitude, user_location.longitude)

        service_distance = geodesic(user_coordinates, cleaner_coordinates).miles
        in_range = service_distance <= availability.max_distance

        return in_range
    ```

    This function takes in the following parameters:

        - `location`: The location of the user as a string (e.g., an address).
        - `availability`: An instance of the `Availability` class that holds information about the provider's availability.
        - `provider`: An instance of the `Provider` class that holds information about the cleaning service provider.

    The function starts by creating a geolocator object from the `Nominatim` class with a user agent string `micro_agents`. The geolocator is then used to obtain the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of both the user's location and the provider's location. The function checks whether the geocoding for both locations was successful. If either location is not found, it raises a `RuntimeError` with a relevant error message. The geographical coordinates of the user's location and the provider's location are used to calculate the distance (in miles) between them using the `geodesic` function from the `geopy.distance` module. The calculated distance is stored in the `service_distance` variable. Finally, the function compares the calculated `service_distance` with the maximum distance allowed for the provider's availability: if the calculated distance is less than or equal to the provider's maximum distance, the user's location is considered within the service range, and the `in_range` variable is set to `True`. Otherwise, the `in_range` variable is set to `False`. The function returns the value of `in_range`, which indicates whether the user's location is within the service area of the provider.

4.  We then need to define an event handler using the `@cleaning_proto.on_message` decorator. This handler is responsible for processing incoming service requests, evaluates various conditions, and generates appropriate responses indicating whether the request is accepted and proposing a price if applicable. It takes in `ServiceRequest` messages and generates `ServiceResponse` messages as responses:

    ```py copy
    @cleaning_proto.on_message(model=ServiceRequest, replies=ServiceResponse)
    async def handle_query_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: ServiceRequest):
        provider = await Provider.filter(name=ctx.name).first()
        availability = await Availability.get(provider=provider)
        services = [int(service.type) for service in await provider.services]
        markup = provider.markup

        user, _ = await User.get_or_create(name=msg.user, address=sender)
        msg_duration_hours: float = msg.duration.total_seconds() / 3600
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received service request from user `{user.name}`")

        if (
            set(msg.services) <= set(services)
            and in_service_region(msg.location, availability, provider)
            and availability.time_start <= msg.time_start
            and availability.time_end >= msg.time_start + msg.duration
            and availability.min_hourly_price * msg_duration_hours < msg.max_price
        ):
            accept = True
            price = markup * availability.min_hourly_price * msg_duration_hours
            ctx.logger.info(f"I am available! Proposing price: {price}.")
        else:
            accept = False
            price = 0
            ctx.logger.info("I am not available. Declining request.")

        await ctx.send(sender, ServiceResponse(accept=accept, price=price))

    ```

    We defined a `@cleaning_proto.on_message()` decorator. Within the decorator, we defined the `handle_query_request()` function which is the actual event handler that gets executed when a `ServiceRequest` message is received. It takes the following arguments: `ctx`, `sender`, and `msg`.

    The handler first retrieves the provider's information, availability, services, and markup using the context's information.
    It uses the `User.get_or_create` method to get or create a user instance based on the user's name and sender address. The function then calculates the message duration in hours. The handler then checks multiple conditions to decide whether the service request can be accepted:

        - Whether the requested services are within the provider's available services.
        - Whether the user's location is within the provider's service area using the `in_service_region` function.
        - Whether the requested time is within the provider's availability.
        - Whether the calculated price based on the minimum hourly price and markup is within the user's maximum price.

    If all conditions are met, the handler sets `accept` to `True` and calculates the proposed `price` based on the markup and availability's minimum hourly price. If any condition is not met, the handler sets `accept` to `False` and the `price` to `0`. Finally, the handler sends a `ServiceResponse` message back to the sender with the calculated `accept` flag and `price`. The handler logs relevant information using the `ctx.logger.info()` method.

5.  We then define another event handler, `handle_book_request()`, using the `@cleaning_proto.on_message()` decorator. This handler processes incoming booking requests, evaluates various conditions, and generates appropriate responses indicating whether the service request was successful. It is triggered whenever a `ServiceBooking` message is received and generates a `BookingResponse` messages as response:

    ```py copy
    @cleaning_proto.on_message(model=ServiceBooking, replies=BookingResponse)
    async def handle_book_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: ServiceBooking):
        provider = await Provider.filter(name=ctx.name).first()
        availability = await Availability.get(provider=provider)
        services = [int(service.type) for service in await provider.services]

        user = await User.get(address=sender)
        msg_duration_hours: float = msg.duration.total_seconds() / 3600
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received booking request from user `{user.name}`")

        success = (
            set(msg.services) <= set(services)
            and availability.time_start <= msg.time_start
            and availability.time_end >= msg.time_start + msg.duration
            and msg.price <= availability.min_hourly_price * msg_duration_hours
        )

        if success:
            availability.time_start = msg.time_start + msg.duration
            await availability.save()
            ctx.logger.info("Accepted task and updated availability.")

        # send the response
        await ctx.send(sender, BookingResponse(success=success))
    ```

    We defined the `@cleaning_proto.on_message()` decorator which is triggered when a ServiceBooking message is received. The event handler `handle_book_request()` function gets executed when a `ServiceBooking` message is received. It takes the following parameters: `ctx`, `sender`, and `msg`. The handler starts by retrieving the provider's information, availability, and services using the context's information. It also retrieves the user instance based on the sender's address, and calculates the message duration in hours. The function then checks multiple conditions to decide whether the booking request can be accepted:

        - Whether the requested services are within the provider's available services.
        - Whether the requested time is within the provider's availability.
        - Whether the requested price is within the acceptable range based on the availability's minimum hourly price and duration.

    If the booking request meets the conditions for success, the handler updates the availability's start time to account for the duration of the service, and then saves the updated availability information. It then uses the `ctx.logger.info()` method to log that the task has been accepted and availability has been updated. Regardless of success, the handler sends a `BookingResponse` message back to the sender with a flag indicating whether the booking request was successful or not.

6.  Save the script.

The overall script should look as follows:

```py copy filename="__init__.py"
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from typing import List

from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
from geopy.distance import geodesic

from uagents import Context, Model, Protocol
from .models import Provider, Availability, User

PROTOCOL_NAME = "cleaning"
PROTOCOL_VERSION = "0.1.0"

class ServiceRequest(Model):
    user: str
    location: str
    time_start: datetime
    duration: timedelta
    services: List[int]
    max_price: float

class ServiceResponse(Model):
    accept: bool
    price: float

class ServiceBooking(Model):
    location: str
    time_start: datetime
    duration: timedelta
    services: List[int]
    price: float

class BookingResponse(Model):
    success: bool

cleaning_proto = Protocol(name=PROTOCOL_NAME, version=PROTOCOL_VERSION)

def in_service_region(
    location: str, availability: Availability, provider: Provider
) -> bool:
    geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="micro_agents")

    user_location = geolocator.geocode(location)
    cleaner_location = geolocator.geocode(provider.location)

    if user_location is None:
        raise RuntimeError(f"user location {location} not found")

    if cleaner_location is None:
        raise RuntimeError(f"provider location {provider.location} not found")

    cleaner_coordinates = (cleaner_location.latitude, cleaner_location.longitude)
    user_coordinates = (user_location.latitude, user_location.longitude)

    service_distance = geodesic(user_coordinates, cleaner_coordinates).miles
    in_range = service_distance <= availability.max_distance

    return in_range

@cleaning_proto.on_message(model=ServiceRequest, replies=ServiceResponse)
async def handle_query_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: ServiceRequest):
    provider = await Provider.filter(name=ctx.name).first()
    availability = await Availability.get(provider=provider)
    services = [int(service.type) for service in await provider.services]
    markup = provider.markup

    user, _ = await User.get_or_create(name=msg.user, address=sender)
    msg_duration_hours: float = msg.duration.total_seconds() / 3600
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received service request from user `{user.name}`")

    if (
        set(msg.services) <= set(services)
        and in_service_region(msg.location, availability, provider)
        and availability.time_start <= msg.time_start
        and availability.time_end >= msg.time_start + msg.duration
        and availability.min_hourly_price * msg_duration_hours < msg.max_price
    ):
        accept = True
        price = markup * availability.min_hourly_price * msg_duration_hours
        ctx.logger.info(f"I am available! Proposing price: {price}.")
    else:
        accept = False
        price = 0
        ctx.logger.info("I am not available. Declining request.")

    await ctx.send(sender, ServiceResponse(accept=accept, price=price))

@cleaning_proto.on_message(model=ServiceBooking, replies=BookingResponse)
async def handle_book_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: ServiceBooking):
    provider = await Provider.filter(name=ctx.name).first()
    availability = await Availability.get(provider=provider)
    services = [int(service.type) for service in await provider.services]

    user = await User.get(address=sender)
    msg_duration_hours: float = msg.duration.total_seconds() / 3600
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received booking request from user `{user.name}`")

    success = (
        set(msg.services) <= set(services)
        and availability.time_start <= msg.time_start
        and availability.time_end >= msg.time_start + msg.duration
        and msg.price <= availability.min_hourly_price * msg_duration_hours
    )

    if success:
        availability.time_start = msg.time_start + msg.duration
        await availability.save()
        ctx.logger.info("Accepted task and updated availability.")

    # send the response
    await ctx.send(sender, BookingResponse(success=success))
```

### Cleaner agent

We are now ready to define our `cleaner` agent.

1. Let's now create a Python script in `cleaning_demo` folder, and name it: `touch cleaner.py`
2. We now need to import the necessary classes and the protocols we previously defined, and then create our `cleaner` agent as an instance of the `Agent` class and make sure it has enough funds to register within the Almanac contract by running the `fund_agent_if_low()` function. The agent is configured with a specific `name`, `port`, `seed`, and `endpoint`.

   ```py copy
   from datetime import datetime
   from pytz import utc

   from tortoise import Tortoise

   from protocols.cleaning import cleaning_proto
   from protocols.cleaning.models import Availability, Provider, Service, ServiceType

   from uagents import Agent, Context
   from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

   cleaner = Agent(
       name="cleaner",
       port=8001,
       seed="cleaner secret phrase",
       endpoint={
           "http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit": {},
       },
   )

   fund_agent_if_low(cleaner.wallet.address())

   # build the cleaning service agent from the cleaning protocol
   cleaner.include(cleaning_proto)
   ```

   The `cleaner` agent includes the previously defined cleaning protocol (`cleaning_proto`) using the `include()` method. This integrates the protocol's models and handlers into the agent's capabilities. The agent is set up to interact with the cleaning service protocol, allowing it to communicate with users and providers according to the logic defined in the protocol's handlers.

3. We then define the behaviors of our `cleaner` agent:

   ```py copy
   @cleaner.on_event("startup")
   async def startup(_ctx: Context):
       await Tortoise.init(
           db_url="sqlite://db.sqlite3", modules={"models": ["protocols.cleaning.models"]}
       )
       await Tortoise.generate_schemas()

       provider = await Provider.create(name=cleaner.name, location="London Kings Cross")

       floor = await Service.create(type=ServiceType.FLOOR)
       window = await Service.create(type=ServiceType.WINDOW)
       laundry = await Service.create(type=ServiceType.LAUNDRY)

       await provider.services.add(floor)
       await provider.services.add(window)
       await provider.services.add(laundry)

       await Availability.create(
           provider=provider,
           time_start=utc.localize(datetime.fromisoformat("2022-01-31 00:00:00")),
           time_end=utc.localize(datetime.fromisoformat("2023-05-01 00:00:00")),
           max_distance=10,
           min_hourly_price=5,
       )

   @cleaner.on_event("shutdown")
   async def shutdown(_ctx: Context):
       await Tortoise.close_connections()

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       cleaner.run()
   ```

   The `startup()` event handler function is decorated with the `.on_event()` decorator. This handler is executed when the `cleaner` agent starts up. Its purpose is to initialize the agent's environment, set up the database, and populate it with necessary data. This function initializes the Tortoise ORM (Objectâ€“Relational Mapping) with the specified database URL and modules. It prepares the ORM to work with the defined data models. The ORM is used to manage database connections and schema generation for the agent's data models. In the snippet above, `db_url` is set to `sqlite://db.sqlite3`, indicating the use of an SQLite database named `db.sqlite3`. `modules` specifies the module containing the data models related to the cleaning protocol. We then define the `Tortoise.generate_schemas()` which is a function that generates the database schemas based on the defined data models. It sets up the necessary tables and relationships in the database. Afterwards, we create instances of the `Provider` and `Service` models and populates them with data.

   A `Provider` instance is created with the `cleaner` agent's name ("cleaner") and location ("London Kings Cross").
   Three `Service` instances are created with different service types: `FLOOR`, `WINDOW`, and `LAUNDRY`. The created `Service` instances are associated with the `Provider` instance using the `provider.services.add()` method. This establishes a relationship between providers and the services they offer. We proceed by defining an `Availability` instance to represent the availability of the cleaning service provider: it includes details such as the provider, start and end times of availability, maximum service distance (10 miles), and minimum hourly price (5).

4. Save the script.

The overall code should look as follows:

```py copy filename="cleaner.py"
from datetime import datetime
from pytz import utc

from tortoise import Tortoise

from protocols.cleaning import cleaning_proto
from protocols.cleaning.models import Availability, Provider, Service, ServiceType

from uagents import Agent, Context
from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

cleaner = Agent(
    name="cleaner",
    port=8001,
    seed="cleaner secret phrase",
    endpoint={
        "http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit": {},
    },
)

fund_agent_if_low(cleaner.wallet.address())

# build the cleaning service agent from the cleaning protocol
cleaner.include(cleaning_proto)

@cleaner.on_event("startup")
async def startup(_ctx: Context):
    await Tortoise.init(
        db_url="sqlite://db.sqlite3", modules={"models": ["protocols.cleaning.models"]}
    )
    await Tortoise.generate_schemas()

    provider = await Provider.create(name=cleaner.name, location="London Kings Cross")

    floor = await Service.create(type=ServiceType.FLOOR)
    window = await Service.create(type=ServiceType.WINDOW)
    laundry = await Service.create(type=ServiceType.LAUNDRY)

    await provider.services.add(floor)
    await provider.services.add(window)
    await provider.services.add(laundry)

    await Availability.create(

        time_end=utc.localize(datetime.fromisoformat("2023-05-01 00:00:00")),
        max_distance=10,
        min_hourly_price=5,
    )

@cleaner.on_event("shutdown")
async def shutdown(_ctx: Context):
    await Tortoise.close_connections()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cleaner.run()
```

### User

We are now ready to define our `user` agent.

1. Let's now create a Python script in `cleaning_demo` folder, and name it: `touch user.py`
2. We need to import the necessary classes and the protocols we previously defined, and then create our `user` agent as an instance of the `Agent` class and make sure it has enough funds to register within the Almanac contract by running the `fund_agent_if_low()` function. The agent is configured with a specific `name`, `port`, `seed`, and `endpoint`. We also define the `cleaner`'s address:

   ```py copy
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   from pytz import utc

   from protocols.cleaning import (
       ServiceBooking,
       BookingResponse,
       ServiceRequest,
       ServiceResponse,
   )

   from protocols.cleaning.models import ServiceType
   from uagents import Agent, Context
   from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

   CLEANER_ADDRESS = "agent1qdfdx6952trs028fxyug7elgcktam9f896ays6u9art4uaf75hwy2j9m87w"

   user = Agent(
       name="user",
       port=8000,
       seed="cleaning user recovery phrase",
       endpoint={
           "http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit": {},
       },
   )

   fund_agent_if_low(user.wallet.address())
   ```

3. Let's define a `ServiceRequest` object to represent a request for cleaning services. It includes information such as the user's name, location, start time, duration, types of services requested, and a maximum price. We also define a `MARKDOWN` to apply a discount or markdown to the service:

   ```py copy
   request = ServiceRequest(
       user=user.name,
       location="London Kings Cross",
       time_start=utc.localize(datetime.fromisoformat("2023-04-10 16:00:00")),
       duration=timedelta(hours=4),
       services=[ServiceType.WINDOW, ServiceType.LAUNDRY],
       max_price=60,
   )

   MARKDOWN = 0.8
   ```

4. We then define an event handler to handle service requests:

   ```py copy
   @user.on_interval(period=3.0, messages=ServiceRequest)
   async def interval(ctx: Context):
       ctx.storage.set("markdown", MARKDOWN)
       completed = ctx.storage.get("completed")

       if not completed:
           ctx.logger.info(f"Requesting cleaning service: {request}")
           await ctx.send(CLEANER_ADDRESS, request)

   ```

   The `interval()` function is decorated with the `.on_interval()` decorator indicating that is is executed at regular intervals specified by the period parameter to send `ServiceRequest` messages. Within the function, the `ctx.storage.set()` method is called to store the `MARKDOWN` constant in the context's storage under the key "markdown". The function first checks the value of `completed` which is retrieved from the context's storage using `ctx.storage.get()` method. This is used to determine whether the service request has already been completed. If the service request is not marked as completed, an informational log message is generated using `ctx.logger.info()` method indicating that a cleaning service request is being made. The `{request}` placeholder in the log message is filled with the details of the request object previously created. Then, `ctx.send()` method is called to send the cleaning service request to the specified address (`CLEANER_ADDRESS`) alongside with the request object.

5. We then would need to define a function for handling responses to service queries and generating service bookings based on the received response:

   ```py copy
   @user.on_message(ServiceResponse, replies=ServiceBooking)
   async def handle_query_response(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: ServiceResponse):
       markdown = ctx.storage.get("markdown")
       if msg.accept:
           ctx.logger.info("Cleaner is available, attempting to book now")
           booking = ServiceBooking(
               location=request.location,
               time_start=request.time_start,
               duration=request.duration,
               services=request.services,
               price=markdown * msg.price,
           )
           await ctx.send(sender, booking)
       else:
           ctx.logger.info("Cleaner is not available - nothing more to do")
           ctx.storage.set("completed", True)
   ```

   The `handle_query_response()` function is decorated with `.on_message()` and handles messages of type `ServiceResponse`. It also specifies that the function replies with instances of `ServiceBooking` data model.

   The function first retrieves the markdown value from the context's storage using `ctx.storage.get()` method. If the received `ServiceResponse` message indicates acceptance, a log message is generated, indicating that a cleaner is available and an attempt to book the service will be made. A `ServiceBooking` object is created, containing information about the location, start time, duration, services, and calculated price (based on the received price in the response message and the markdown value). The `ServiceBooking` object is then sent to the sender's address using `ctx.send()` method.

   If however the response message does not indicate acceptance, a log message is generated, indicating that a cleaner is not available. The "completed" key in the storage is set to `True`, indicating that the service request process has been completed.

6. We finally need to define a function for handling `BookingResponse` messages:

   ```py copy
   @user.on_message(BookingResponse, replies=set())
   async def handle_book_response(ctx: Context, _sender: str, msg: BookingResponse):
       if msg.success:
           ctx.logger.info("Booking was successful")
       else:
           ctx.logger.info("Booking was UNSUCCESSFUL")

       ctx.storage.set("completed", True)


   if __name__ == "__main__":
       user.run()
   ```

   The `handle_book_response()` function is decorated with `.on_message()` decorator indicating that it's meant to handle messages of type BookingResponse. However, it specifies `replies=set()`, which means that this function is not intended to send any replies. The function processes the booking response message: if the `success` field in the message is `True`, a log message is generated indicating that the booking was successful using `ctx.logger.info()` method. If the success field is `False`, a log message is generated indicating that the booking was unsuccessful. The "completed" key in the context's storage is set to `True` using the `ctx.storage.set()` method to indicate that the entire booking process has been completed.

7. Save the script.

The overall script should look as follows:

```py copy filename="user.py"
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pytz import utc

from protocols.cleaning import (
    ServiceBooking,
    BookingResponse,
    ServiceRequest,
    ServiceResponse,
)
from protocols.cleaning.models import ServiceType
from uagents import Agent, Context
from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

CLEANER_ADDRESS = "agent1qdfdx6952trs028fxyug7elgcktam9f896ays6u9art4uaf75hwy2j9m87w"

user = Agent(
    name="user",
    port=8000,
    seed="cleaning user recovery phrase",
    endpoint={
        "http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit": {},
    },
)

fund_agent_if_low(user.wallet.address())

request = ServiceRequest(
    user=user.name,
    location="London Kings Cross",
    time_start=utc.localize(datetime.fromisoformat("2023-04-10 16:00:00")),
    duration=timedelta(hours=4),
    services=[ServiceType.WINDOW, ServiceType.LAUNDRY],
    max_price=60,
)

MARKDOWN = 0.8

@user.on_interval(period=3.0, messages=ServiceRequest)
async def interval(ctx: Context):
    ctx.storage.set("markdown", MARKDOWN)
    completed = ctx.storage.get("completed")

    if not completed:
        ctx.logger.info(f"Requesting cleaning service: {request}")
        await ctx.send(CLEANER_ADDRESS, request)

@user.on_message(ServiceResponse, replies=ServiceBooking)
async def handle_query_response(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: ServiceResponse):
    markdown = ctx.storage.get("markdown")
    if msg.accept:
        ctx.logger.info("Cleaner is available, attempting to book now")
        booking = ServiceBooking(
            location=request.location,
            time_start=request.time_start,
            duration=request.duration,
            services=request.services,
            price=markdown * msg.price,
        )
        await ctx.send(sender, booking)
    else:
        ctx.logger.info("Cleaner is not available - nothing more to do")
        ctx.storage.set("completed", True)

@user.on_message(BookingResponse, replies=set())
async def handle_book_response(ctx: Context, _sender: str, msg: BookingResponse):
    if msg.success:
        ctx.logger.info("Booking was successful")
    else:
        ctx.logger.info("Booking was UNSUCCESSFUL")

    ctx.storage.set("completed", True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user.run()
```

## Run the scripts

Run the **cleaner** agent and then the **user** agent from different terminals:

- Terminal 1: `python cleaner.py`
- Terminal 2: `python user.py`

The output should be as follows, depending on the terminal:

- **Cleaner**

```
[cleaner]: Received service request from user `user`
[cleaner]: I am available! Proposing price: 22.0.
[cleaner]: Received booking request from user `user`
[cleaner]: Accepted task and updated availability.
```

- **User**

```
[ user]: Requesting cleaning service: user='user' location='London Kings Cross' time_start=datetime.datetime(2023, 4, 10, 16, 0, tzinfo=<UTC>) duration=datetime.timedelta(seconds=14400) services=[<ServiceType.WINDOW: 2>, <ServiceType.LAUNDRY: 3>] max_price=60.0
[ user]: Cleaner is available, attempting to book now
[ user]: Booking was successful
```
