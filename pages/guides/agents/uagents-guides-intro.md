# Introduction to Î¼Agents guides ðŸ¤– 

The guides provide a general overview of the concepts and processes required in order to acquire the necessary experience and terminology to enable you to create agents with confidence and according to your specific needs. The guides section of the documentation covers everything from the creation of your first agent and the covering of the most basic concepts within the framework to more complex scenarios in which one or more agents perform certain activities in order to pursue a utility for its user. 

In the first guides, these cover the most basic concepts, including addresses, storage and how to use these concepts to create agents performing simple operations, from saying hello and its name to perform interval tasks at specified periods. 

Subsequently, the guides cover more complex but fundamental concepts to be able to create applications of any kind. These more extensive guides include several use cases and scenarios, including:

- How to book a table at a restaurant using uAgents.
- How to use uAgents to verify messages.
- How to use uAgents to send tokens.
- How to use the uAgents to simulate a cleaning scenario.
- Creating an agent to generate revenue on your data.
