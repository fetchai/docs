# Creating your first ŒºAgent ü§ñüßë‚Äçüíª

## Introduction

The ŒºAgents Framework makes it easy to build agents for all kinds of decentralized use cases.

In this guide we want to show you the steps needed for _creating your first ŒºAgent in a blink of an eye!_

**Let's get started!**

## Create a ŒºAgent saying hello and its name

### Walk-through

Here, we want to show how to create your first ŒºAgent using the tools provided by Fetch.ai `uagents` library. You can create your first ŒºAgent by following the steps below:

1. First of all, let's create a Python script for this task, and name it: `touch agent.py`

2. We then need to import the `Agent` and `Context` classes from the `uagents` library, and then create a ŒºAgent using the class `Agent`:

   ```py copy
   from uagents import Agent, Context
   alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")
   ```

   It is optional but useful to include a `seed` parameter when creating an agent to set fixed [addresses ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/getting-uagent-address.md)Ô∏è. Otherwise, random addresses will be generated every time you run the agent.

3. Let's define a `say_hello()` function for our agent to print a message periodically saying hello:

   ```py copy
   @alice.on_event("startup")
   async def say_hello(ctx: Context):
       ctx.logger.info(f'hello, my name is {ctx.name}')

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       alice.run()
   ```

   The `.on_interval` decorator defines a periodic behavior for this agent. In this case, the agent will execute the `say_hello()` function every 2 seconds. The `Context` object is a collection of data and functions related to the agent. In this case, we just use the agent's name, `alice`. The agent executes the function and uses the `ctx.logger.info()` method to print the message.

4. Save the script

The overall script should look as follows:

```py copy filename="agent.py"
from uagents import Agent, Context

alice = Agent(name="alice", seed="alice recovery phrase")

@alice.on_event("startup")
async def say_hello(ctx: Context):
    ctx.logger.info(f'hello, my name is {ctx.name}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    alice.run()
```

### Run your agent

Make sure to have activated your virtual environment correctly.

Run the script: `python agent.py`

The output would be:

```
[alice]: hello, my name is alice
```

_**Congratulations, you have just created your first ŒºAgent!**_
