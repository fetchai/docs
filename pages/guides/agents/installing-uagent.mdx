## Simplified Installation for Windows users 

Installing the uagents framework on a Windows machine is a straightforward process. The uagents framework is a Python package, so you'll need to have Python installed on your system before you can use it. 


If you don't already have Python installed on your Windows machine, follow these steps to download and install it:
Visit the official Python website at [Python ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/.Download) and download the latest stable version of Python for Windows. 

Run the downloaded installer executable file (e.g., python-3.x.x.exe).
During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python X.X to PATH." This will automatically add Python to your system's PATH variable, making it easier to use from the command line.


Install uagents Using pip
Once you have Python installed and added to your PATH, follow these steps to install the uagents framework using pip:

    1. To install using PIP open your terminal.
To ensure that pip (Python's package manager) is up to date, run the following command:

```py
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

    2. Now, you can install the uagents framework by running the following command:

```py
pip install uagents
```

Pip will download and install the uagents package and its dependencies. Wait for the process to complete. To verify the complete installation explore your terminal. As part of the installation you will see a message showcasing the completion of the installation as well as the exact version.
