# Registering in Almanac Contract

## Introduction

The [Almanac ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview) contract requires agents to register using their **Agent Address** and pay a fee for registration to be found by other agents on the network.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have read the following resources before going on with this guide:

    - [Quick Start Guide for uAgents Framework ↗️](/guides/agents/quickstart)
    - [Creating your first agent ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/create-a-uagent)
    - [Agents address ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/getting-uagent-address)
    - [Almanac contract ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/almanac)
    - [Register in Almanac ↗️](/guides/agents/register-in-almanac)

## Imports needed

    - [uAgents ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/)

## Walk-through

1. First of all, create a Python script and name it:

   <CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
   <DocsCode mac={true}>
       ```py copy filename="mac"
       touch registration.py
       ```
   </DocsCode>
   <DocsCode windows={true}>
       ```py copy filename="windows"
       echo. > registration.py
       ```
   </DocsCode>

   <DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
       ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
       touch registration.py
       ```
       </DocsCode>

   </CodeGroup>

2. Open your terminal and `registration.py` file in an editor of your choice. Let's start by importing the `Agent` class from the `uagents` library to create our Agent. This function will check if you have enough tokens to register in the Almanac contract, if not it will add testnet tokens to your `ASI Network address`. Then, create an agent, `alice`, you need to provide the `name`, `seed`, `port` and `endpoint` parameters to correctly run it! The code will look similar to the following:

<GithubCodeSegment digest="5ce0153e7a3d445dd4f8945b30a2b473">
    <CodeSegment
        path="https://github.com/fetchai/uAgent-Examples/blob/main/5-documentation/guides/agents/advanced/register-in-almanac/registration.py"
        lineStart={1}
        lineEnd={17}
        hosted={true}
    />
</GithubCodeSegment>
<CodeGroup dynamic hasCopy isLocalHostedFile digest='5ce0153e7a3d445dd4f8945b30a2b473'>

<DocsCode local={true}>
	```py copy filename="registration.py"

	from uagents import Agent, Context, Protocol
	
	agent = Agent(
	    name="alice",
	    port=8000,
	    seed="alice secret phrase",
	    endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
	)
	
	@agent.on_interval(period=3)
	async def hi(ctx: Context):
	    ctx.logger.info(f"Hello")
	
	agent.run()

```
</DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>



There's a few things happening in this script; we initialize Alice with an endpoint. An endpoint is the address in which other agents can send messages to where Alice will be listening. As highlighted in [Registration and Endpoints Weighting ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/endpoints), agents can communicate by querying the Almanac and retrieving an endpoint from the recipient agent. Therefore, we need to specify the service endpoints when defining our agents.

We also have to define `agent.run()`. This `.run()` function runs the agent, but more importantly this registers the agent to the Almanac when code is initialized.

Once you run your script, your agent will start the registration process automatically. Finally, it will try to register on the Almanac contract. Then, we will be ready to start to a remote communication with other agents registered within the Almanac contract. The output should be similar to:

   ```
   INFO:     [Alice]: Registration on Almanac API successful
   INFO:     [Alice]: Registering on almanac contract...
   INFO:     [Alice]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
   INFO:     [Alice]: Hello
   INFO:     [Alice]: Agent inspector available at https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8000&address=agent1qfccl7xc2hrwzntx9rxgf56lh80kuf5av6h4nyk3ywvxyu846zqwyl3g0jf
   INFO:     [Alice]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   INFO:     [Alice]: Hello
   INFO:     [Alice]: Hello
   INFO:     [Alice]: Hello
   ```

The output for the above code would be similar to the following:

   ```
   INFO:     [alice]: Registration on Almanac API successful
   INFO:     [alice]: Registering on almanac contract...
   INFO:     [alice]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
   INFO:     [alice]: Agent inspector available at https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8000&address=agent1q0c5m0ugjml6rwa05fwe8wecqnxjc8vk6grqwlylpp9h4nfzxm4cyaha7r8
   INFO:     [alice]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   INFO:     [alice]: Hello
   INFO:     [alice]: Hello
   INFO:     [alice]: Hello
   ```
