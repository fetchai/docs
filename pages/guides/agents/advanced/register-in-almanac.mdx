# Registering in Almanac Contract

## Introduction

The [Almanac ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview) contract requires agents to register using their **Agent Address** and pay a fee for registration to be found by other agents on the network.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have read the following resources before going on with this guide:

    - [Quick Start Guide for uAgents Framework ↗️](/guides/agents/quickstart)
    - [Creating your first agent ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/create-a-uagent)
    - [Agents address ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/getting-uagent-address)
    - [Almanac contract ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/almanac)
    - [Register in Almanac ↗️](/guides/agents/register-in-almanac)

## Imports needed

    - [uAgents ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/)

## Walk-through

1. First of all, create a Python script and name it:

    <CodeGroup isOSFile>

        ```py copy filename="mac"
        touch registration.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="windows"
        echo. > registration.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
        touch registration.py
        ```

    </CodeGroup>
   
2. Then, import the `Agent` class from the `uagents` library to create our agent, and the `fund_agent_if_low` class from the `uagents.setup` module. This function will check if you have enough tokens to register in the Almanac contract, if not it will add testnet tokens to your `Fetch Network address`. Then, create an agent, `alice`, you need to provide the `name`, `seed`, `port` and `endpoint` parameters to correctly run it! The code will look similar to the following:

    ```py copy filename="registration.py"
    from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Protocol

    agent = Agent(
        name="alice",
        port=8000,
        seed="alice secret phrase",
        endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
    )

    fund_agent_if_low(agent.wallet.address())

    @agent.on_interval(period=3)
    async def hi(ctx: Context):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Hello")

    agent.run()
    ```

There's a few things happening in this script; we initialize Alice with an endpoint. An endpoint is the address in which other agents can send messages to where Alice will be listening. As highlighted in [Registration and Endpoints Weighting ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/endpoints), agents can communicate by querying the Almanac and retrieving an endpoint from the recipient agent. Therefore, we need to specify the service endpoints when defining our agents.

We also have to define `agent.run()`. This `.run()` function runs the agent, but more importantly this registers the agent to the Almanac when code is initialized.

Once you run your script, your agent will start the registration process automatically, the balance of the agent's wallet will be checked and funded if needed. Finally, it will try to register on the Almanac contract. Then, we will be ready to start to a remote communication with other agents registered within the Almanac contract.
