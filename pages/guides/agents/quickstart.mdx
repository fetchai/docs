# Quick Start Guide for uAgents Framework

This **quickstart guide** quickly guides you through installing the uAgents Framework and building a couple of agents in a few steps.

## Installation

### System requirements

    - **Python 3.8+**: A popular programming language.
    - **PIP**: Python package manager for installing libraries.
    - **Poetry (optional)**: For managing virtual environments and dependencies.
    - **Windows, Mac or Ubuntu**.

### Installation steps

1. Create a **Project Directory**. Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project:

    ```py copy
    mkdir directory_name
    cd directory_name
    ```

2. Initialize and activate virtual environment. Use **Poetry** to initialize and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```py copy
    poetry init -n && poetry shell
    ```

3. Install **uAgents Framework**.

    ```py copy
    poetry add uagents
    ```

4. Verify installation. Check if the installation was successful.

    ```py copy
    poetry show uagents
    ```

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes you may face errors installing, we list the most common reasons below:

**Problem on MacOS/Python 3.11**: Installing coincurve (17.0.0) fails.

#### Solution

Install the necessary tools.

    ```py
    brew install automake autoconf libtool
    ```

## Creating a simple agent

We should create something simple to get started, below the most basic of agents performs a task periodically.

Create a new Python script:

    <CodeGroup isOSFile>

        ```py copy filename="mac"
        touch interval_task.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="windows"
        echo. > interval_task.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
        touch interval_task.py
        ```

    </CodeGroup>

Open `interval_task.py` in your text editor and add the following code:

    ```py copy filename="interval_task.py"
    from uagents import Agent, Context

    # Create an agent named Alice
    alice = Agent(name="alice", seed=YOUR NEW PHRASE)

    # Define a periodic task for Alice
    @alice.on_interval(period=2.0)
    async def say_hello(ctx: Context):
        ctx.logger.info(f'hello, my name is {alice.name}')

    # Run the agent
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        alice.run()
    ```

Be sure to update `seed` with a unique phrase, your seed will need to be wrapped in `"`.

#### Run Script

Run the script to see the output:

    ```py copy
    python interval_task.py
    ```

**Expected Output**:

    ```
    INFO:     [alice]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    INFO:     hello, my name is alice
    INFO:     hello, my name is alice
    INFO:     hello, my name is alice
    ```

## Message Handling Example

This guide will walk you through creating a simple interaction between two agents. The first will send a message to the second one at regular intervals, and this latter one will handle and log the received messages.

Create 2 new Python scripts:

    <CodeGroup isOSFile>

        ```py copy filename="mac"
        touch SenderAgent.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="windows"
        echo. > SenderAgent.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
        touch SenderAgent.py
        ```

    </CodeGroup>

    <CodeGroup isOSFile>

        ```py copy filename="mac"
        touch ReceiverAgent.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="windows"
        echo. > ReceiverAgent.py
        ```

        ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
        touch ReceiverAgent.py
        ```

    </CodeGroup>

Open `SenderAgent.py` in your text editor and add the following code:

      ```py copy filename="SenderAgent.py"
      from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
      
      
      class Message(Model):
          message: str
      
      
      RECIPIENT_ADDRESS = (
          "test-agent://agent1qd8ymq4najh5wycvhvhcw3l5lmkgkvkrqevrs6wpp5ll0khfdq6v2cq6859"
      )
      
      SenderAgent = Agent(
          name="SenderAgent",
          port=8000,
          seed="SenderAgent secret phrase",
          endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
      )
      
      print(SenderAgent.address)

      @SenderAgent.on_interval(period=2.0)
      async def send_message(ctx: Context):
          await ctx.send(RECIPIENT_ADDRESS, Message(message="Hi there. Let's start our conversation!"))
      
      
      @SenderAgent.on_message(model=Message)
      async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
          ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")
      
      
      if __name__ == "__main__":
          SenderAgent.run()
      ```

Then, open `ReceiverAgent.py` in your text editor and add the following code into it:

       ```py copy filename="ReceiverAgent.py"
      from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
      
      # NOTE: Run ReceiverAgent.py before running SenderAgent.py
      
      
      class Message(Model):
          message: str
      
      
      ReceiverAgent = Agent(
          name="ReceiverAgent",
          port=8001,
          seed="ReceiverAgent secret phrase",
          endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit"],
      )
      
      print(ReceiverAgent.address)
      
      @ReceiverAgent.on_message(model=Message)
      async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
          ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")
      
          # send the response
          await ctx.send(sender, Message(message="Cool! Let's get started!"))
      
      
      if __name__ == "__main__":
          ReceiverAgent.run()
       ```
Again, be sure to update `seed` with a unique phrase.

#### Run Script

Run the scripts to see the agents communicating:

   ```py copy
   python SenderAgent.py
   ```

   ```py copy
   python ReceiverAgent.py
   ```

**Expected Output**:


- **SenderAgent**:

   ```
