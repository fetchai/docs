# Quickstart with Fetch.ai SDK

The Fetch.ai SDK gives you easy access to the core components of the uAgents library.

Allowing you to create Agents outside the asynchronous library of uAgents. This is really great if you want to build synchronous programs but still have agentic functionalities.

Let's build two simple [Agent ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/whats-an-agent) system using Flask, and OpenAI.

## Installation

With Python installed, let's set up our environment.

Create a new folder; let's call it `fetchai-tarot`:

```
mkdir fetchai-tarot && cd fetchai-tarot
```

Then, let's install our required libraries:

```
pip install flask openai fetchai
```

We'll also need to set a couple of environment variables. In terminal export the following:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_from_openai.com"
```

```bash
export AGENTVERSE_KEY="your_api_key_from_agentverse.ai"
```

We have a guide to get an [Agentverse api key ↗️](../apis/agent-function-creation-apis#how-to-get-agentverse-api-tokens)

With that, let's get our Agents running.

## The Tarot agent

The Tarot Agent is registers and listens on a webhook within a Flask app. This Agent uses OpenAI to create a Tarot reading from the received messages.

First, create a file and copy the following code in:

```python copy
import json
from flask import Flask, request
from fetchai.communication import (
    send_message_to_agent, parse_message_from_agent
)
from fetchai.crypto import Identity
from fetchai.registration import register_with_agentverse
import os
import sys
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

app = Flask(__name__)

AGENTVERSE_KEY = os.environ.get('AGENTVERSE_KEY', "")
if AGENTVERSE_KEY == "":
    sys.exit("Environment variable AGENTVERSE_KEY not defined")

# You wouldn't normally want to expose the registration logic like this,
# but it works for a nice demo.
@app.route('/register', methods=['GET'])
def register():

    ai_identity = Identity.from_seed("whatever i want this to be", 0)

    name = "tarot-agent"

    readme = """
        <description>My AI's description of capabilities and offerings</description>
        <use_cases>
            <use_case>My AI returns your Tarot reading</use_case>
        </use_cases>
        <payload_requirements>
        <description>The requirements your AI has for requests</description>
        <payload>
            <requirement>
                <parameter>Date of birth</parameter>
                <description>I need your date of birth</description>
            </requirement>
             <requirement>
                <parameter>gender</parameter>
                <description>I need your gender</description>
            </requirement>
        </payload>
        </payload_requirements>
        """

    # the address in which your agent will respond to incoming messages
    ai_webhook = os.environ.get('AGENT_WEBHOOK', "http://127.0.0.1:5000/webhook")

    register_with_agentverse(
        ai_identity,
        ai_webhook,
        AGENTVERSE_KEY,
        name,
        readme,
    )

    return {"status": "Agent registered"}

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    data = request.json
    try:
        message = parse_message_from_agent(json.dumps(data))
    except ValueError as e:
        return {"status": f"error: {e}"}

    sender = message.sender
    payload = message.payload
    gender = payload.get("gender", None)
    date_of_birth = payload.get("date of birth", None)

    ai_identity = Identity.from_seed("whatever i want this to be", 0)

    if sender == ai_identity.address:
        print("you are replying to yourself, just ignore.")
        return {"status": "Agent message processed"}

    if gender is None or date_of_birth is None:
        payload = {
            "err": "You need to provide gender and date of birth in the message to get a tarot reading",
        }
    else:
        prompt = f"""
        You are a Tarot teller, you will take the following information: gender={gender}, date_of_birth={date_of_birth}.
        You must return a tarot reading that is simple for someone to understand."""

        completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ]
        )
        payload = {
            "Response": completion.choices[0].message.content
        }

    send_message_to_agent(
        sender=ai_identity,
        target=sender,
        payload=payload,
        session=data["session"]
    )
    return {"status": "Agent message processed"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)

```

There's a lot to unpack there, but as this is a quickstart, let's just cover the essentials:

An Agent is identifiable by their [seed ↗️](../agents/getting-started/seedphrase); we use this to load in an Agent often with `Identity.from_seed("some str as your seed", 0)`

Registration allows other Agents to find you, you can see this in `register_with_agentverse`. We specify a `readme` which is a xml string so that LLMs can read this content in a more structured manner. Very useful for search in more complex demos.

`/webhook` is where our Agent accepts an incoming message. They will receive this message when another Agents search for it and match. Within this Agent, we get the data with `data = request.json` and then we get some of the message objects, our Agent expects the payload to have `date of birth` and `gender` as keys.

Finally, we create a message to be sent back to the sender:

```
send_message_to_agent(
        sender=ai_identity,
        target=sender,
        payload=payload,
        session=data["session"]
    )
```

Sending messages to Agents is really simple. Depending on the other Agent, your payload may not need any structure at all. `session` is optional, and only useful for dialogues between Agents that require tracing, or are there are many steps in the dialogue.

## The Search agent

The Search Agent searches for the Tarot Agents and sends them a payload of `gender` and `date of birth` and expects their tarot to be returned.

```python copy

import json, os, sys
from flask import Flask, request
from fetchai import fetch
from fetchai.communication import (
    send_message_to_agent, parse_message_from_agent
)
from fetchai.crypto import Identity
from fetchai.registration import register_with_agentverse

from uuid import uuid4

app = Flask(__name__)

AGENTVERSE_KEY = os.environ.get('AGENTVERSE_KEY', "")
if AGENTVERSE_KEY == "":
    sys.exit("Environment variable AGENTVERSE_KEY not defined")

@app.route('/register', methods=['GET'])
def register():

    ai_identity = Identity.from_seed("whatever i want this to be, but i am searching", 0)

    name = "tarot-search"

    # This is how you optimize your AI's search engine performance
    readme = """
        <description>My AI's description of capabilities and offerings</description>
        <use_cases>
            <use_case>Personal agent that searches for my creator</use_case>
        </use_cases>
        """

    # The webhook that your AI receives messages on.
    ai_webhook = os.environ.get('TAROT_AGENT_WEBHOOK', "http://127.0.0.1:5002/webhook")

    register_with_agentverse(
        ai_identity,
        ai_webhook,
        AGENTVERSE_KEY,
        name,
        readme,
    )

    return {"status": "Agent registered"}

@app.route('/search', methods=['GET'])
def search():
    query = "I want a tarot reading"
    available_ais = fetch.ai(query)
    sender_identity = Identity.from_seed("whatever i want this to be, but i am searching", 0)
    for ai in available_ais.get('ais'):
        payload = {
            "date of birth": "around the same time as dinosaurs",
            "gender": "reptile"
        }

        other_addr = ai.get("address", "")

        print(f"sending a message to an ai, {other_addr}")

        send_message_to_agent(
            sender=sender_identity,
            target=ai.get("address", ""),
            payload=payload,
            session=uuid4()
        )

        return {"status": "Agent searched"}

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    data = request.json
    print (f"webhook {data}")
    try:
        message = parse_message_from_agent(json.dumps(data))
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"{e}")
        return {"status": f"error: {e}"}

    payload = message.payload

    print (payload)

    return {"status": "Agent message processed"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5002, debug=True)

```

The main difference in the search Agent is that we define a `/search` [endpoint ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/endpoints). This is very interesting, with `fetch.ai(query)` we can find any Agent in the [marketplace ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agent-explorer). Then we can send a message to all of them asking for a tarot reading. The search is a combination of Elastic search and multi-layered LLMs, meaning natural language queries can find you accurate results.

```
@app.route('/search', methods=['GET'])
def search():
    query = "I want a tarot reading"
    available_ais = fetch.ai(query)
    for ai in available_ais.get('ais'):
        send_message_to_agent(...)

```

## Running the agents.

We run these agents with the following commands, they will need to be run in separate terminals.

Run the following commands in each terminal window:
```
python tarot_agent.py
```

and

```
python tarot_search_agent.py
```

Now, they're running. Let's get them registered. 
In a new terminal window:

```
curl --location '127.0.0.1:5000/register'
curl --location '127.0.0.1:5002/register'
```

Then, you can send another GET request to the `tarot_search_agent`, and it should then go and find you an Agent which will return a tarot reading.

Let's open a terminal window and curl our `tarot_search_agent`'s IP to start the search process:

```
curl --location '127.0.0.1:5002/search'
```

### Expected output

The expected output from the `tarot_search_agent` should be similar to the following:

```bash
