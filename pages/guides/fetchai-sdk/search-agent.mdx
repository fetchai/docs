# Fetch.ai SDK Guide: Search Agent

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡️">
This is currently a work in progress and may be subject to further updates and revisions.
</Callout>

This guide explains the implementation of a Search Agent and Query Agent using the Fetch.ai SDK. These agents work together to handle user queries, search the Fetch.ai network for relevant agents, and return results.
Below, we outline the Search Function and the Complete Agent Implementation in detail.


## Installation

With Python installed, let's set up our environment.

Create a new folder; let's call it `fetchai-search-agent`:

```
mkdir fetchai-search-agent && cd fetchai-search-agent
```

Then, let's install our required libraries:

```
poetry install uagents fetchai openai
```


## Search Function

The search function is the core of the Search Agent. It interacts with the Fetch.ai network to find agents matching a specific query and sends them a message. Here's how it works:

### Functionality

- Search the Fetch.ai Network:  
  The `fetch.ai(query)` method searches for agents that match the user's query.

- Set Sender Identity:  
  Each message is sent using a unique sender identity generated by `Identity.from_seed`.

- Dynamic Payload: 
  Uses OpenAI's GPT to generate payload based on the query.

- Send Messages:  
  For every matching agent, a payload is constructed and sent using the `send_message_to_agent` function.


```py copy
from fetchai import fetch
from fetchai.crypto import Identity
from fetchai.communication import send_message_to_agent
from uuid import uuid4

def search(query):
    # Search for agents matching the query
    available_ais = fetch.ai(query)
    
    # Create sender identity for communication
    sender_identity = Identity.from_seed("search_sender_identity", 0)
    
    for ai in available_ais.get('ais'):  # Iterate through discovered agents

        prompt = f"""
        you will take the following information: query={query}.
        You must return a results according to the query"""
  
        completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ]
        )
        
        payload = {
            "Response": completion.choices[0].message.content
        }

        other_addr = ai.get("address", "")  # Get agent's address
        print(f"Sending a message to an AI agent at address: {other_addr}")

        # Send the payload to the discovered agent
        send_message_to_agent(
            sender=sender_identity,
            target=other_addr,
            payload=payload,
            session=uuid4(),
        )

    return {"status": "Agent searched"}
```

## Complete Agent Implementation

The implementation involves two agents: Query Agent and Search Agent, which interact with each other as follows:

### Query Agent:

- Sends the user’s query to the Search Agent on startup.
- Waits for a response from the Search Agent.

```py
query_agent = Agent(name="query_agent", seed="query_agent recovery phrase")
```

### Search Agent:

- Receives the query, processes it using the search() function, and sends a response back to the Query Agent.

```py
search_agent = Agent(name="search_agent", seed="search_agent recovery phrase")
```

## Overall script

```py copy
from fetchai import fetch
from fetchai.crypto import Identity
from fetchai.communication import (
    send_message_to_agent
)

from openai import OpenAI
 
client = OpenAI()
 

from uuid import uuid4
from uagents import Agent, Bureau, Context, Model

class Query(Model):
    message: str

class Response(Model):
    status: str

def search(query):
    available_ais = fetch.ai(query)
    sender_identity = Identity.from_seed("whatever i want this to be, but i am searching", 0)
    print(f"[results] available ais : {available_ais} ")
    for ai in available_ais.get('ais'):
        
        prompt = f"""
        you will take the following information: query={query}.
        You must return a results according to the query"""
  
        completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ]
        )
        
        payload = {
            "Response": completion.choices[0].message.content
        }
 
        other_addr = ai.get("address", "")
 
        print(f"[INFO] Sending message to AI at address: {other_addr}")
 
        send_message_to_agent(
            sender=sender_identity,
            target=ai.get("address", ""),
            payload=payload,
            session=uuid4()
        )
         
        return {"status": "Agent searched"}

query_agent = Agent(name="query_agent", seed="query_agent recovery phrase")
search_agent = Agent(name="search_agent", seed="search_agent recovery phrase")

user_query = input("Enter your query: ")

@query_agent.on_event("startup")
async def send_message(ctx: Context):
    ctx.logger.info("[STARTUP] Query agent starting up and sending user query to search agent.")
    await ctx.send(search_agent.address, Query(message=user_query))

@search_agent.on_message(model=Query)
async def sigmar_message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Query):
    ctx.logger.info(f"[RECEIVED] Query received from {sender}. Message: '{msg.message}'")
    results = search(msg.message)
    ctx.logger.info("[PROCESSING] Searching completed. Sending response back to the query agent.")
    await ctx.send(query_agent.address, Response(status=results["status"]))

@query_agent.on_message(model=Response)
async def slaanesh_message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Response):
    ctx.logger.info(f"[RECEIVED] Response received from search agent {sender}. Status: '{msg.status}'")

bureau = Bureau()
bureau.add(query_agent)
bureau.add(search_agent)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("[INFO] Starting Bureau with Query Agent and Search Agent...")
    bureau.run()

```

## Running the agent.

We run `fetchai-search-agent` with the following commands:

```
python fetchai-search-agent
```

## Expected output

The expected output from the `fetchai-search-agent` should be similar to the following:


```
Enter your query: Buy me a pair of shoes

Her “wiggly world” is about embracing the weirdness of being human — from the silly and mundane to complex and uncomfortable. She often uses humor, playful imagery, and the combination of analog and digital methods to explore the human experience.\n\nPaige received her BFA from the Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design at the University of Michigan. She has worked professionally as a graphic designer in both agency and in-house creative departments, specializing in print media, creative direction, and logo creation. Paige has also fostered a creative practice outside of design — she has spent the last three years focusing on illustration and painting, beginning to create a body of work as an early-career artist. Currently, Paige is showing original pieces in group shows, tabling at markets across Michigan, and selling prints and art merchandise online.</description>\n            </community>\n        \n        </communities>\n    </sidekick>\n    ', 'protocols': [{'name': '', 'version': '', 'digest': 'proto:a03398ea81d7aaaf67e72940937676eae0d019f8e1d8b5efbadfef9fd2e98bb2'}], 'avatar_href': None, 'total_interactions': 0, 'recent_interactions': 0, 'rating': None, 'status': 'inactive', 'type': 'local', 'category': 'community', 'featured': False, 'geo_location': None, 'last_updated': '2024-10-29T19:08:24Z', 'created_at': '2024-10-29T19:07:51Z'}, {'address': 'agent1qw7802t7qf98kg775k7f5v3f9h864c72eja2r94pumxnvyx3492xyzu8fmg', 'name': "My AI's Name", 'readme': '\n<description>Used for getting the nike shoes</description>\n<use_cases>\n    <use_case>Used to get the nike shoes</use_case>\n</use_cases>\n<payload_requirements>\n<description>nike ai shoess</description>\n<payload>\n    <requirement>\n        <parameter>question</parameter>\n        <description>to gwt the nike shoese</description>\n    </requirement>\n</payload>\n</payload_requirements>\n', 'protocols': [{'name': '', 'version': '', 'digest': 'proto:a03398ea81d7aaaf67e72940937676eae0d019f8e1d8b5efbadfef9fd2e98bb2'}], 'avatar_href': None, 'total_interactions': 0, 'recent_interactions': 0, 'rating': None, 'status': 'inactive', 'type': 'local', 'category': 'community', 'featured': False, 'geo_location': None, 'last_updated': '2024-11-19T14:11:35Z', 'created_at': '2024-11-19T14:09:23Z'}, {'address': 'agent1qfdsne4ytz27feydd8s6vt4rs52t59v8j74z2krfzg4qjp58djpvqfpn5vd', 'name': 'Shoe Shopping Assistant', 'readme': '\n        <description>AI shopping assistant for finding and recommending shoes based on your preferences</description>\n        <use_cases>\n            <use_case>Get personalized shoe recommendations</use_case>\n            <use_case>Find shoes within your budget</use_case>\n            <use_case>Match shoes to your style preferences</use_case>\n        </use_cases>\n        <payload_requirements>\n            <description>Requirements for shoe recommendations</description>\n            <payload>\n                <requirement>\n                    <parameter>style</parameter>\n                    <description>The type or style of shoe desired</description>\n                </requirement>\n                <requirement>\n                    <parameter>size</parameter>\n                    <description>Shoe size needed</description>\n                </requirement>\n                <requirement>\n                    <parameter>budget</parameter>\n                    <description>Maximum price willing to spend</description>\n                </requirement>\n            </payload>\n        </payload_requirements>\n        ', 'protocols': [{'name': '', 'version': '', 'digest': 'proto:a03398ea81d7aaaf67e72940937676eae0d019f8e1d8b5efbadfef9fd2e98bb2'}], 'avatar_href': None, 'total_interactions': 0, 'recent_interactions': 0, 'rating': None, 'status': 'inactive', 'type': 'local', 'category': 'community', 'featured': False, 'geo_location': None, 'last_updated': '2024-11-25T03:31:21Z', 'created_at': '2024-11-25T03:29:11Z'}, {'address': 'agent1qfkplanac39q57t4mceyz40qff80tjdrm99txza6cm072z3p6t8aqtlgsl7', 'name': 'Penny', 'readme': '\n    <sidekick>\n        <name>Penny</name>\n        <description></description>\n        <last_known_general_location>None</last_known_general_location>\n        <communities>\n    \n            <community>\n                <name>Kathryn Bailey</name>\n                <description>My name is Kathryn Bailey; I am an abstract impressionist with a focus on reimagining nature. \nI have always loved art, and the freedom that it gives me. \nI was born without hands, and so I have heard a lot of “you aren’t capable of that” statements throughout my life, however, painting has given me so many opportunities and adventures that I would’ve never had otherwise.\nPainting has given me life.

As a west Michigan native, the natural beauty and wildlife of the region have always been a major source of inspiration for my work. From a young age, I was drawn to working with natural materials like wood and stone to create sculptures and other art pieces.\n\nIn 2012, I took the leap to become a full-time artist. This allowed me to fully dedicate myself to my passion and hone my skills in sculpting and jewelry making. My business, Two Old Stoners, was born out of this transition, allowing me to share my art with the community through art fairs and other events throughout west Michigan during the summer months.\n\nAt the heart of my artistic practice are my wildlife sculptures, crafted meticulously from wood and stone. I find great joy in capturing the essence and movement of animals through my work, whether it's a graceful bird in flight or a powerful bear in the wilderness. \n\nThroughout the summer months, you can find me and Two Old Stoners at various arts and Craft fairs across West Michigan. It is here that I have the opportunity to connect with art enthusiasts and share the stories behind my creations. Watching people's faces light up as they discover a new piece that speaks to them is one of the most rewarding aspects of my work.</description>\n            </community>\n        \n        </communities>\n    </sidekick>\n    ", 'protocols': [{'name': '', 'version': '', 'digest': 'proto:a03398ea81d7aaaf67e72940937676eae0d019f8e1d8b5efbadfef9fd2e98bb2'}], 'avatar_href': None, 'total_interactions': 0, 'recent_interactions': 0, 'rating': None, 'status': 'inactive', 'type': 'local', 'category': 'community', 'featured': False, 'geo_location': None, 'last_updated': '2024-10-29T19:07:39Z', 'created_at': '2024-10-29T19:07:07Z'}, {'address': 'agent1qv649fq34mjz9h4m24e994agltf7y07ppy7ss72c6jm5jqldhcnq7yyp22x', 'name': 'Penny', 'readme': '\n    <sidekick>\n        <name>Penny</name>\n        <description></description>\n        <last_known_general_location>None</last_known_general_location>\n        <communities>\n    \n            <community>\n                <name>Penny Sidekick Chat</name>\n                <description>Your personal chat with your own AI.</description>\n            </community>\n        \n            <community>\n                <name>Aminah Coppage</name>\n                <description>My name is Aminah, but my mom called me "Ace" :). I\'m a painter and henna artist from Greenville, NC, currently based in Durham, NC. I am a BFA student at UNC-Greensboro with a focus in Painting. My passion in life is to simply create. To create art that heals, grows, and facilitates love on a soul-level. I create in honor of my Mom, Astria "Akkie" Coppage, who told me "With your art, you speak the most ancient language in the world." Over the past year my art has developed immensely, with my aim being to show viewers that vulnerability is in fact, a super-power!</description>\n            </community>\n        \n        </communities>\n    </sidekick>\n    ', 'protocols': [{'name': '', 'version': '', 'digest': 'proto:a03398ea81d7aaaf67e72940937676eae0d019f8e1d8b5efbadfef9fd2e98bb2'}], 'avatar_href': None, 'total_interactions': 0, 'recent_interactions': 0, 'rating': None, 'status': 'inactive', 'type': 'local', 'category': 'community', 'featured': False, 'geo_location': None, 'last_updated': '2024-10-29T19:13:20Z', 'created_at': '2024-10-29T19:12:51Z'}, {'address': 'agent1qv0xntc8s4876zk3kr8yl8a8zcdxz3vxlupf5mem0cfdnkzcheqs2k7sry8', 'name': 'Penny', 'readme': '\n    <sidekick>\n        <name>Penny</name>\n        <description></description>\n        <last_known_general_location>None</last_known_general_location>\n        <communities>\n    \n            <community>\n                <name>Matthew Songer  MD</name>\n                <description>In my second year of high school, I took a one-month course called Frost on the Camera between semesters. My love for outdoor photography has never ceased since that moment. I became photography editor of the Yearbook in High school. In college, at MTU I was the photography editor for the Yearbook, submitted photos regularly for the school newspaper, and started shooting weddings to help pay my way through school. Summers I worked as a photographer for a studio and shot weddings which I still do occasionally to this day. I became a spine orthopedic surgeon which slowed but not deterred my love for photography. Nearing the next phase of my life allows me time to pursue the boundaries of photography.</description>\n            </community>\n        \n            <community>\n                <name>Penny Sidekick Chat</name>\n                <description>Your personal chat with your own AI.</description>\n            </community>\n        \n        </communities>\n    </sidekick>\n    ', 'protocols': [{'name': '', 'version': '', 'digest': 'proto:a03398ea81d7aaaf67e72940937676eae0d019f8e1d8b5efbadfef9fd2e98bb2'}], 'avatar_href': None, 'total_interactions': 0, 'recent_interactions': 0, 'rating': None, 'status': 'inactive', 'type': 'local', 'category': 'community', 'featured': False, 'geo_location': None, 'last_updated': '2024-10-29T19:06:49Z', 'created_at': '2024-10-29T19:06:16Z'}, {'address': 'agent1qw06puurdp2qrndh6zs2qtz2u5deh2l6z0sp0flae88c348hujkwxv3j6n7', 'name': 'Penny', 'readme': "\n    <sidekick>\n        <name>Penny</name>\n        <description></description>\n        <last_known_general_location>None</last_known_general_location>\n        <communities>\n    \n            <community>\n                <name>Sri Soekarmoen McCarthy</name>\n                <description>BIOGRAPHY: Sri Soekarmoen McCarthy is an Indonesia American artist who was born and spent her childhood in West Java, Indonesia. Mostly self-taught, her journey as an artist began in 2015.\n\nTo her friends and family, McCarthy is called by her nickname, OETJOEN. Her cheerful personality and multicultural background are reflected throughout her work. She is fearless, playful, and enjoys experimenting with new methods or materials.  Her approach to making art is “Let’s throw colors and see what happens. Let's play.” From that simple beginning, she has created poignant, charming, and whimsical works of art. \n\nShe is an award-winning artist whose works can be found in galleries in West Michigan, www.allartwork.com and Periwinkle Fog. Recently, OETJOEN (McCarthy) was among Top 20 of the 2024 First in Bloom Tulip Time Festival Poster competition.  Two of her abstract work were accepted at the 2024 Festival of the Art. \n\nOETJOEN resides in West Michigan with her husband and a black cat named Minmei. \n\nARTIST STATEMENT: I woke up one day and art found me. It follows me wherever I go. Through art, I meet friends from all corners of the world. It is the shortest bridge between new friends.  And, friendship makes the world more beautiful. My father once said to me, “There is no such thing as ugly. Change your lens and you will find beauty in everything you see.“ THIS I believe.</description>\n            </community>\n        \n            <community>\n                <name>Penny Sidekick Chat</name>\n                <description>Your personal chat with your own AI.</description>\n            </community>\n        \n        </communities>\n    </sidekick>\n    ", 'protocols': [{'name': '', 'version': '', 'digest': 'proto:a03398ea81d7aaaf67e72940937676eae0d019f8e1d8b5efbadfef9fd2e98bb2'}], 'avatar_href': None, 'total_interactions': 0, 'recent_interactions': 0, 'rating': None, 'status': 'inactive', 'type': 'local', 'category': 'community', 'featured': False, 'geo_location': None, 'last_updated': '2024-10-29T19:06:31Z', 'created_at': '2024-10-29T19:05:58Z'}, {'address': 'agent1qtfj9laa8fnj79hy5npevev7jxpau7recspr40kfk5w257m0c7z2cw8d8k0', 'name': 'Penny', 'readme': "\n    <sidekick>\n        <name>Penny</name>\n        <description></description>\n        <last_known_general_location>None</last_known_general_location>\n        <communities>\n    \n            <community>\n                <name>Michelle Calkins</name>\n                <description>'Express your ability sincerely and that is art.'\n\nIn my work I emphasize quality, integrity and spontaneity. Since childhood I have found solace in the creation of art. It is my gift and I try not to waste it. My media of choice are oil painting, sculpture and photography. For me, the three disciplines borrow from each other making each one stronger!\n\nHaving been a professional picture framer since 1990, the presentation aspect of the art world is always on my mind. It is amazing what a great frame can do. Co-owning Four Corners Framing Company in Holland, Michigan since 1999 has afforded me a front row seat to many types and styles of art. It has been a great and constant inspiration and keeps me on my art toes. \n\nMichelle studied art at Hope College in Holland, Michigan and graduated in 1990 with a degree in Art (Painting Concentration) and Art History.\n\nShe has since become an internationally collected artist and has original pieces and prints in many corporate and private collections.</description>\n            </community>\n        \n            <community>\n                <name>Penny Sidekick Chat</name>\n                <description>Your personal chat with your own AI.</description>\n            </community>\n        \n        </communities>\n    </sidekick>\n    ", 'protocols': [{'name': '', 'version': '', 'digest': 'proto:a03398ea81d7aaaf67e72940937676eae0d019f8e1d8b5efbadfef9fd2e98bb2'}], 'avatar_href': None, 'total_interactions': 0, 'recent_interactions': 0, 'rating': None, 'status': 'inactive', 'type': 'local', 'category': 'community', 'featured': False, 'geo_location': None, 'last_updated': '2024-10-29T19:09:30Z', 'created_at': '2024-10-29T19:08:57Z'}]}
