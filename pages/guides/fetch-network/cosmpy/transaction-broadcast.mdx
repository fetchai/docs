# Sending funds

CosmPy allows for simplification of transactions broadcasting. After [creating a wallet ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/cosmpy/creating-wallet) you can send transactions by following the below provided example. In it, we first connect to the desired network then provide the desired destination address. The transaction is then broadcast using the `Ledger_client.send_tokens()` function:

    ```py copy
    from cosmpy.aerial.client import LedgerClient, NetworkConfig

    # Establishing connection to the network
    ledger_client = LedgerClient(NetworkConfig.fetch_mainnet())

    # Providing destination address
    destination_address = 'fetch1h2l3cnu7e23whmd5yrfeunacez9tv0plv5rxqy'

    # Broadcasting the transaction
    tx = ledger_client.send_tokens(destination_address, 10, "atestfet", wallet)

    # block until the transaction has been successful or failed
    tx.wait_to_complete()
    ```

    In this example, we want to send 10 atestfet tokens to the `destination_address`. The `send_tokens()` method is called on the `ledger_client` object, which is an instance of the `LedgerClient` class used to interact with the Fetch.ai blockchain network. The parameter wallet is the local wallet used to sign the transaction and provide the necessary credentials. The code then waits for the transaction to complete (either successfully or failed) before proceeding further.

## Sending and verifying a transaction

For a more comprehensive example, we will use the **testnet** and submit a transaction then verify its completion by exploring the output on the terminal. For transactions made on the mainnet it is advisable to use our [block explorer ↗️](https://explore.fetch.ai/) or any other block explorer, such as [Mintscan ↗️](https://www.mintscan.io/fetchai). The following code snippet shows you how to create two wallets, namely for `alice` and `bob`.

Once created, the next step is to establish a connection to Fetch.ai's testnet. We then query `alice`'s balance and include a while function to make sure `alice` has a positive balance and can perform the transaction. In this case `alice` will send `bob` 10 atestfet. As a final step, we will print the transaction hash, as well as `bob`'s and `alice`'s related balances:

Once you have executed the script, you will notice the console output is consistent with the code. At first, we see a print of the starting balance of both addresses. Then, we see the transaction hash along with the new balances for both `alice` and `bob`:

    ```
    Alice Address: fetch1kfsarzv8s0kl7pcznjgyc6mnaz96akl79kzttv Balance: 10000000000000000000
    Bob   Address: fetch1ww8gsxk4usmq0tdjyele4nqyxcmc3zquu3fc52 Balance: 0
    TX 25E8F5D9F101DB5AC57DC5FF2566BA4F290609B6AADBFF1D566B398BA5FFAF48 waiting to complete...
    TX 25E8F5D9F101DB5AC57DC5FF2566BA4F290609B6AADBFF1D566B398BA5FFAF48 waiting to complete...done
    Alice Address: fetch1kfsarzv8s0kl7pcznjgyc6mnaz96akl79kzttv Balance: 9999416775000000512
    Bob   Address: fetch1ww8gsxk4usmq0tdjyele4nqyxcmc3zquu3fc52 Balance: 10
    ```
