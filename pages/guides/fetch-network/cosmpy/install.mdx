# Installation üõ†

Welcome to **CosmPy**, the Python-based library that streamlines your interactions with Cosmos SDK based blockchain networks.

## System Requirements

The [CosmPy ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://pypi.org/project/cosmpy/) package is a Python library running on Ubuntu/Debian, and MacOS systems.

On your computer, you may need to install:

    - [Python ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8, 3.9 or 3.10.
    - [PIP ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (Python Installs Packages).
    - [Poetry ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://python-poetry.org/) for virtual environments (optional).
    - [CosmPy ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://pypi.org/project/cosmpy/).

## Walk-through
## Install with Pip

    1. First of all, create a directory for cosmpy related projects: `mkdir directory_name`

    2. Within the directory, let's create and open a virtual environment using Poetry: `poetry init -n && poetry shell` (Optional)

    3. Then, install CosmPy with the following command: `pip install cosmpy`

    4. Finally, check if installation was successful: `pip show cosmpy`

Once installed, you should see the following output on your terminal:

    ```
