# Querying balances

Once you have established a [connection to a network node ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/cosmpy/establishing-node-connection), you can use the `LegderClient` object to perform many useful operations, such as **querying balances**. In particular the `LedgerClient` object allows you to:

    1. Query all balances associated with a **particular address**.
    2. Query all balances associated with a **particular denomination**.

Let's explore how to achieve both.

    1. We start by importing CosmPy as well as the relevant modules.
    2. Then, we connect to the chain we want to perform the query on.
    3. Once connected, we specify the address we want to query. In our example we will connect to the Fetch.ai mainnet and we query all balances associated with a particular address:

        ```py copy
        import cosmpy
        from cosmpy.aerial.client import LedgerClient, NetworkConfig

        ledger_client = LedgerClient(NetworkConfig.fetch_mainnet())

        address: str = 'fetch12q5gw9l9d0yyq2th77x6pjsesczpsly8h5089x'
        balances = ledger_client.query_bank_all_balances(address)
        print(balances)
        ```

Whenever **querying all balances associated with a _particular address_** returns a `List` of `Coin` objects that contain `amount` and `denom` variables that correspond to all the funds held at the address and their denominations.

      This list includes all natively defined coins along with any tokens transferred using the inter-blockchain communication [IBC ↗️](https://ibcprotocol.org/) protocol.
    </Callout>

Once completed, you will see the following output in your terminal:

    ```py copy
    [Coin(amount='1616060698998992698400', denom='afet'), Coin(amount='10', denom='ibc/605C5B80A8253543F8038F96F56BA13BDD8D300E12F1B32A3FA2E1EB2A933FA1'), Coin(amount='5000000', denom='ibc/B58E6786772640EC4B538AFC4393F742C326734B74CCAFAFBF7EFDC7D435B428')]
    ```

In order to **query all balances associated with a _particular denomination_*+, we can run the same script but substitute the final balance command we used in the snippet above, with:

    ```py
    balance = ledger_client.query_bank_balance(address, denom='afet')
    ```

This will return the value of the (integer) funds held by the address with the specified denomination. If the `denom` argument is omitted the function will return the fee denomination specified in the `NetworkConfig` object used to initialize the `LedgerClient`.
