# Wallet top-up ðŸ’µ

## Introduction

If you are performing multiple transactions from a certain `task_wallet`, you can set an algorithm to keep that wallet address topped-up. For this use case, we will use three different wallets: `wallet`, `authz_wallet`, and `task_wallet`. Wallet will be the main wallet address that we don't want to give full access to, therefore we will authorize `authz_wallet` to send a certain amount of tokens from wallet to `task_wallet` every time `task_wallet` balance falls below a certain `minimum_balance` threshold. This way, `task_wallet` can keep performing transactions using the main wallet's tokens by being topped-up by `authz_wallet`.

Let's start by defining `wallet`, `authz_wallet` and `task_wallet` address.

```py copy
from cosmpy.aerial.wallet import LocalWallet
from cosmpy.crypto.keypairs import PrivateKey
from cosmpy.aerial.client import LedgerClient, NetworkConfig

ledger = LedgerClient(NetworkConfig.latest_stable_testnet())

# Define wallets with any private keys
wallet = LocalWallet(PrivateKey("F7w1yHq1QIcQiSqV27YSwk+i1i+Y4JMKhkpawCQIh6s="))

authz_wallet = LocalWallet(
    PrivateKey("KI5AZQcr+FNl2usnSIQYpXsGWvBxKLRDkieUNIvMOV8=")
)

# Define any task_wallet address
task_wallet_address = 'fetch1ay6grfwhlm00wydwa3nw0x2u44qz4hg2uku8dc'
