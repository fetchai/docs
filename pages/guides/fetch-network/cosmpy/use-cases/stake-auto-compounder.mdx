# Stake auto-compounder

## Introduction

The Stake Auto-Compounder is a CosmPy based use case developed using Python and designed to automate the process of staking tokens in a blockchain network, claiming rewards, and compounding those rewards by re-delegating them to a validator. When an account delegates tokens to a network's validator, it will start generating rewards proportionally to the amount of [`Stake` ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/cosmpy/staking) delegated. But since rewards are not automatically added to your stake and therefore do not contribute to future rewards, we can perform a compounding strategy to generate exponential rewards.

## Delegate your tokens

The first thing we need to do is delegate some tokens to a `validator`. You can do so by using a [`Wallet` ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/cosmpy/creating-wallet) and specifying the validator address and amount. you can delegate tokens to a specific validator by using the `delegate_tokens` method of the `ledger_client` object and specifying the validator's address, the amount of tokens and the wallet from which the delegation is made:

    ```py copy
    validators = ledger_client.query_validators()

    # choose any validator
    validator = validators[0]

    key = PrivateKey("FX5BZQcr+FNl2usnSIQYpXsGWvBxKLRDkieUNIvMOV7=")
    wallet = LocalWallet(key)

    # delegate some tokens to this validator
    tx = ledger_client.delegate_tokens(validator.address, 9000000000000000000, wallet)
    tx.wait_to_complete()
    ```

## Auto-compounder

We can write a script helping us claiming rewards and delegating the rewarded tokens back to the `validator` of choice. This way we keep growing our `Stake` given the generated compounded rewards on such staked amount. We first need to define the `time limit` and the compounding `period`.

Importantly, bear in mind that each time an account performs a claim or a delegate a transaction, it has to pay certain fees. Therefore, the compounding period has to be long enough to generate sufficient rewards to exceed the fees that will be paid in each transaction and generate a profit.

After having defined such parameters, we can then start a timer that claims rewards and delegates them in each time period:

    ```py copy
    time_check = 0
    start_time = time.monotonic()
    time.sleep(period)

    # query, claim and delegate rewards after time period
    while time_check < time_limit:

        begin = time.monotonic()

        summary = ledger_client.query_staking_summary(wallet.address())
        print(f"Staked: {summary.total_staked}")

        balance_before = ledger_client.query_bank_balance(wallet.address())

        tx = ledger_client.claim_rewards(validator.address, wallet)
        tx.wait_to_complete()

        balance_after = ledger_client.query_bank_balance(wallet.address())

        # reward after any fees
        true_reward = balance_after - balance_before

        if true_reward > 0:

            print(f"Staking {true_reward} (reward after fees)")

            tx = ledger_client.delegate_tokens(validator.address, true_reward, wallet)
            tx.wait_to_complete()

        else:
            print("Fees from claim rewards transaction exceeded reward")

        end = time.monotonic()

        time.sleep(period-(end-begin))
        time_check = time.monotonic() - start_time
    ```

    In the code snippet above we defined a while loop running until the timer exceeds the `time limit`. Each loop will last the time specified in `period`. We query the balance before and after claiming rewards to get the value of the reward after any fees. If the true reward value is positive, we delegate those tokens to the validator, if it is negative, it means that the fees from claiming and delegating transactions exceeded the rewards, and therefore we will not delegate.

## Walk-through

Below we provide a step-by-step guide to create an auto compounder using the `cosmpy.aerial` package.

1. First of all, create a Python script and name it:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
```py copy filename="mac"
touch aerial_compounder.py
```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > aerial_compounder.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch aerial_compounder.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>
</CodeGroup>

2. We need to import the necessary modules, including `argparse`, `time`, and various modules from the `cosmpy.aerial` package:

    ```py copy
    import argparse
    import time

    from cosmpy.aerial.client import LedgerClient
    from cosmpy.aerial.config import NetworkConfig
    from cosmpy.aerial.faucet import FaucetApi
    from cosmpy.aerial.wallet import LocalWallet
    ```

3. We now need to define a `_parse_commandline()` function responsible for parsing command-line arguments when the script is being executed:

    ```py copy
    def _parse_commandline():
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument(
            "initial_stake",
            type=int,
            nargs="?",
            default=9000000000000000000,
            help="Initial amount of atestfet to delegate to validator",
        )
        parser.add_argument(
            "time_limit",
            type=int,
            nargs="?",
            default=600,
            help="total time",
        )
        parser.add_argument(
            "period",
            type=int,
            nargs="?",
            default=100,
            help="compounding period",
        )

        return parser.parse_args()
    ```

    We first create a `parser` instance of the `ArgumentParser` class using the `argparse` module. Argument parsers are used to specify and parse command-line arguments. The `add_argument()` method is used to specify the arguments that the script will accept. It takes several parameters, including:

        - `name`: the name of the argument.
        - `type`: the type to which the argument should be converted (in this case, `int`).
        - `nargs`: the number of arguments expected (in this case, `"?"` means zero or one argument).
        - `default`: the default value if the argument is not provided.
        - `help`: a brief description of the argument, which will be displayed if the user asks for help with the script.

    Three arguments are defined in this function:

        - `initial_stake`: the initial amount of tokens to delegate to a validator. It expects an integer and has a default value of `9000000000000000000`.
        - `time_limit`: the total time limit for the compounder. It expects an integer (representing seconds) and has a default value of `600` seconds (10 minutes).
        - `period`: the compounding period, which is the interval between each compounding operation. It expects an integer (also in seconds) and has a default value of `100` seconds.

    The last line of the snippet above, `parser.parse_args()`, parses the command-line arguments provided when the script is executed. The function returns the parsed arguments object.

4. We are now ready to define our `main()` function:

    ```py copy
    def main():
        """Run main."""
        args = _parse_commandline()

        ledger = LedgerClient(NetworkConfig.fetchai_stable_testnet())
        faucet_api = FaucetApi(NetworkConfig.fetchai_stable_testnet())

        # get all the active validators on the network
        validators = ledger.query_validators()

        # choose any validator
        validator = validators[0]

        alice = LocalWallet.generate()

        wallet_balance = ledger.query_bank_balance(alice.address())
        initial_stake = args.initial_stake

        while wallet_balance < (initial_stake):
            print("Providing wealth to wallet...")
            faucet_api.get_wealth(alice.address())
            wallet_balance = ledger.query_bank_balance(alice.address())

        # delegate some tokens to this validator
        tx = ledger.delegate_tokens(validator.address, initial_stake, alice)
        tx.wait_to_complete()

        # set time limit and compounding period in seconds
        time_limit = args.time_limit
        period = args.period

        time_check = 0
        start_time = time.monotonic()
        time.sleep(period)

        # query, claim and stake rewards after time period
        while time_check < time_limit:

            begin = time.monotonic()

            summary = ledger.query_staking_summary(alice.address())
            print(f"Staked: {summary.total_staked}")

            balance_before = ledger.query_bank_balance(alice.address())

            tx = ledger.claim_rewards(validator.address, alice)
            tx.wait_to_complete()

            balance_after = ledger.query_bank_balance(alice.address())

            # reward after any fees
            true_reward = balance_after - balance_before

            if true_reward > 0:

                print(f"Staking {true_reward} (reward after fees)")

                tx = ledger.delegate_tokens(validator.address, true_reward, alice)
                tx.wait_to_complete()

            else:
                print("Fees from claim rewards transaction exceeded reward")

            print()

            end = time.monotonic()
            time.sleep(period - (end - begin))
            time_check = time.monotonic() - start_time


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    The first line calls the `_parse_commandline()` function we defined earlier. It returns an object with the parsed command-line arguments. We then create two objects:

         - A `ledger` instance of the `Ledger Client` class configured for the Fetch.ai stable testnet. This client will be used to interact with the blockchain network.
         - A `faucet_api` instance of the `Faucet API` class configured for the Fetch.ai stable testnet. This API is used for providing additional funds to the wallet if needed.

    We then need to get all the active validators on the network by using the `query_validators()` method. After this, we choose a validator and create a new wallet named `alice` using `LocalWallet.generate()` and check the balance of the `alice` wallet. If the balance is less than the initial stake, it enters a loop to provide wealth to the wallet using the faucet API until the balance reaches the specified initial stake. We can now delegate the initial stake of tokens to the chosen validator using the `delegate_tokens()` method.

    We proceed by setting time limits and periods. `time_limit = args.time_limit` sets the time limit based on the command-line argument, whereas `period = args.period` sets the compounding period based on the command-line argument. After this, we define the compounding loop, similar to what was described in the first part of this guide: it iterates over a specified time period, queries staking summary, claims rewards, and either stakes the rewards or skips if fees exceed rewards. Time management is important here: indeed, the loop keeps track of time using `time.monotonic()` to ensure it does not exceed the specified time limit. It waits for the specified period before starting the next compounding cycle.

5. Save the script.

The overall script should look as follows:

```py copy filename="aerial_compounder.py"
import argparse
import time

from cosmpy.aerial.client import LedgerClient
from cosmpy.aerial.config import NetworkConfig
from cosmpy.aerial.faucet import FaucetApi

    parser.add_argument(
        "initial_stake",
        type=int,
        nargs="?",
        default=9000000000000000000,
        help="Initial amount of atestfet to delegate to validator",
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "time_limit",
        type=int,
        nargs="?",
        default=600,
        help="total time",
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "period",
        type=int,
        nargs="?",
        default=100,
        help="compounding period",
    )

    return parser.parse_args()

    """Run main."""
    args = _parse_commandline()

    # choose any validator
    validator = validators[0]

    alice = LocalWallet.generate()

    wallet_balance = ledger.query_bank_balance(alice.address())
    initial_stake = args.initial_stake

    while wallet_balance < (initial_stake):
        print("Providing wealth to wallet...")
        faucet_api.get_wealth(alice.address())
        wallet_balance = ledger.query_bank_balance(alice.address())

    # delegate some tokens to this validator
    tx = ledger.delegate_tokens(validator.address, initial_stake, alice)
    tx.wait_to_complete()

    # set time limit and compounding period in seconds
    time_limit = args.time_limit
    period = args.period

    time_check = 0
    start_time = time.monotonic()
    time.sleep(period)

    # query, claim and stake rewards after time period
    while time_check < time_limit:

        begin = time.monotonic()

        summary = ledger.query_staking_summary(alice.address())
        print(f"Staked: {summary.total_staked}")

        balance_before = ledger.query_bank_balance(alice.address())

        tx = ledger.claim_rewards(validator.address, alice)
        tx.wait_to_complete()

        balance_after = ledger.query_bank_balance(alice.address())

        # reward after any fees
        true_reward = balance_after - balance_before

        if true_reward > 0:

            print(f"Staking {true_reward} (reward after fees)")

            tx = ledger.delegate_tokens(validator.address, true_reward, alice)
            tx.wait_to_complete()

        else:
            print("Fees from claim rewards transaction exceeded reward")

        print()

        end = time.monotonic()
        time.sleep(period - (end - begin))
        time_check = time.monotonic() - start_time


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
