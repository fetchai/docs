# Smart contracts

## Deploy a smart contract

CosmPy offers the possibility to easily deploy **smart contracts** using the `LedgerContract` object. For this, you will need the **path** to where the contract is stored (in this case `simple.wasm`), a [`LedgerClient` ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/cosmpy/establishing-node-connection) and a [Wallet ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/cosmpy/creating-wallet).

The example below shows how to achieve this:

    ```py copy
    from cosmpy.aerial.contract import LedgerContract

    PATH = "contracts/simple/simple.wasm"

    contract = LedgerContract(PATH, ledger_client)
    contract.deploy({}, wallet)
    ```

## Interact with smart contracts

We can now start interacting with any smart contract in different ways by executing one of the following operations.

### Retrieve contract address

After deployment, you can obtain the address of the deployed contract on the network using the `address` method in the following way:

    ```py copy
    print(f"Contract deployed at: {contract.address}")
    ```

### Query contract's state variables

We can also query the values of the contract's state variables using the `query` method and provide a dictionary specifying the query information:

    ```py copy
    result = contract.query({"get": {"owner": wallet}})
    print("Initial state:", result)
    ```

### Set contract's state variables

We can update the contract's state variables by using the `execute` method and by providing a dictionary specifying the update wanted. Use the `wait_to_complete()` method to wait for the execution to finish.

The following code sets the state variable `value` to `foobar`:

    ```py copy
    contract.execute({"set": {"value": "foobar"}}, wallet).wait_to_complete()
    ```

Once you set a state variable to its updated value, you can query it again to confirm such changes took place effectively. Considering the example above, we can check if changes were set correctly in the following way:

    ```py copy
    result = contract.query({"get": {"owner": wallet)}})
    print("State after set:", result)
    ```

### Clear state variables

We can clear the contract's state variables using the `execute` method in the following way:

    ```py copy
    contract.execute({"clear": {}}, wallet).wait_to_complete()
    ```

Then, we can check if the operation was correctly executed by running what follows:

    ```py copy
    result = contract.query({"get": {"owner": wallet}})
    print("State after clear:", result)
    ```
