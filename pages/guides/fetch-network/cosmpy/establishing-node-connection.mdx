# Connecting to a blockchain

Once you have installed CosmPy, you can **connect and begin interacting with Cosmos-based blockchains**. You can do so by running the following command:

    ```py copy
    import cosmpy
    from cosmpy.aerial.client import LedgerClient, NetworkConfig

    # Connecting to the Fetch.ai mainnet
    ledger_client = LedgerClient(NetworkConfig.fetch_mainnet())
    ```

In the code snippet above, we are using the `LedgerClient` as a client object which takes a `NetworkConfig` as an argument. For ease of use, network configurations are provided automatically. For instance, `NetworkConfig.fetch_mainnet()` is the configuration for the [Fetch ledger ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/intro). However, CosmPy allows you to customize the network configuration and interact with other chains.

Below, you can find an example of a custom network configuration:

    ```py copy
    cfg = NetworkConfig(
        chain_id="cosmoshub-4",
        url="grpc+https://grpc-cosmoshub.blockapsis.com:429",
        fee_minimum_gas_price=1,
        fee_denomination="uatom",
        staking_denomination="uatom",
    )

    ledger_client = LedgerClient(cfg)
    ```
