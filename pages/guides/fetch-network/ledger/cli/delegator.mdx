# CLI - Delegation

Delegations refers to the act of assigning the responsibility of validating transactions and creating new blocks to a specific validator node. Below you can find different operations executable through the [CLI ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/intro).

## How to query the current staking holdings of validators

You can query the current staking holdings of validators using the `fetchd`CLI, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd query staking validators
    ```

This command will provide information about all the existing validators in the network, including details such as their operator address, consensus public key, status, tokens staked, commission rates, and more.

The output will be a list of validators, each represented in a block of information, similar to the example you provided earlier. This information gives an overview of each validator's status and staked tokens.

On `dorado` test network, this command will produce an output similar to the following:

    ```text
    - |

      minselfdelegation: "1000000000000000000000"
      producingblocks: true
    ...
    ```

Similarly, if you wish to retrieve the same information but now for a **single validator**, use the following command, by providing the `operator_address` of the specific validator:

    ```bash
    fetchd query staking validator operator_address
    ```

For instance:

    ```bash
    fetchd query staking validator fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
    ```

This command will provide detailed information about the specific validator, including their commission rates, minimum self-delegation, and other relevant details.

A delegator will be particularly interested in the following keys:

    - `commission/commission_rates/rate`: the commission rate on revenue charged to any delegator by the validator.
    - `commission/commission_rates/max_change_rate`: the maximum daily increase of the validator's commission. This parameter cannot be changed by the validator operator.
    - `commission/commission_rates/max_rate`: the maximum commission rate this validator can charge. This parameter cannot be changed by the validator operator.
    - `minselfdelegation`: minimum amount of `atestfet` the validator need to have bonded at all time. If the validator's self-bonded stake falls below this limit, their entire staking pool (i.e. all its delegators) will unbond. This parameter exists as a safeguard for delegators. Indeed, when a validator misbehaves, part of their total stake gets slashed. This includes the validator's self-delegateds stake as well as their delegators' stake. Thus, a validator with a high amount of self-delegated `atestfet` has more skin-in-the-game than a validator with a low amount. The minimum self-bond amount parameter guarantees to delegators that a validator will never fall below a certain amount of self-bonded stake, thereby ensuring a minimum level of skin-in-the-game. This parameter can only be increased by the validator operator.

### How to query the delegations made to a validator

You can **query the list of delegations made to a specific validator** using the `fetchd` command-line interface, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd query staking delegations-to fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
    ```

Here, replace `VALIDATOR_OPERATOR_ADDRESS` with the actual operator address of the validator you are interested in. For instance:

    ```bash
    fetchd query staking delegations-to VALIDATOR_OPERATOR_ADDRESS
    ```

This command will provide information about the delegations made to the specified validator, including details such as the delegator's address, the validator's address, and the amount of shares and tokens delegated.

Below, you can find an example of delegations to `validator2` received on `dorado` testnet:

    ```text
    - delegation:
        delegator_address: fetch1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t9zzruef
        validator_address: fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
        shares: "1000000000000000000000.000000000000000000"
      balance:
        denom: atestfet
        amount: "1000000000000000000000"
    - delegation:
        delegator_address: fetch15fn3meky8ktfry3qm73xkpjckzw4dazxpfx34m
        validator_address: fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
        shares: "100000.000000000000000000"
      balance:
        denom: atestfet
        amount: "100000"
    ```

This output shows two delegations made to the validator, along with the delegator's address, the validator's address, the number of shares, and the amount of tokens delegated.

### How to query re-delegations

Re-delegation is the process of transferring already delegated tokens from one validator to another. This allows participants to change their delegation strategy without having to unbond and wait for the unbonding period to complete.

Delegators can choose to re-delegate the tokens they already delegated from one validator to another at any time. Re-delegation takes effect immediately, without any waiting period. However, the tokens can not be re-delegated until the initial re-delegation transaction has completed its 21 day completion time. The unlocking time is indicated by the `redelegationentry/completion_time` field in the outputs below.

You can **query the list of re-delegations made from a validator** by using the `fetchd` command-line interface and run the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd query staking redelegations-from VALIDATOR_OPERATOR_ADDRESS
    ```

Replace `VALIDATOR_OPERATOR_ADDRESS` with the actual operator address of the validator you are interested in. For instance:

    ```bash
    fetchd query staking redelegations-from fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
    ```

This command will provide information about the re-delegations made from the specified validator, including details such as the delegator's address, the source validator's address, the destination validator's address, and information about the re-delegation entries. The output will be a list of re-delegations, each represented in a block of information. Below you can find an example output:

    ```text
    fetchd query staking redelegations-from fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
    - redelegation:
        delegator_address: fetch15fn3meky8ktfry3qm73xkpjckzw4dazxpfx34m
        validator_src_address: fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
        validator_dst_address: fetchvaloper122veneudkzyalay6gusvrhhpp0560mparpanvu
        entries: []
      entries:
      - redelegationentry:
          creation_height: 291037
          completion_time: 2021-03-24T14:24:38.973444629Z
          initial_balance: "50000"
          shares_dst: "50000.000000000000000000"
        balance: "50000"
      - redelegationentry:
          creation_height: 291133
          completion_time: 2021-03-24T14:33:43.425472866Z
          initial_balance: "10000"
          shares_dst: "10000.000000000000000000"
        balance: "10000"
    ```

Here, delegator `fetch15fn3meky8ktfry3qm73xkpjckzw4dazxpfx34m` issued 2 re-delegations from `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w` to `fetchvaloper122veneudkzyalay6gusvrhhpp0560mparpanvu`:

Similarly, you can obtain the list of re-delegations issued by a delegator by running the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd query staking redelegations fetch15fn3meky8ktfry3qm73xkpjckzw4dazxpfx34m
    ```

### How to query rewards

Once you have delegated tokens to a validator, you will be eligible to a share of the rewards the validator collects.

If you wish to **retrieve all the outstanding rewards for a specific address**, run the following command using the `fetchd` command-line interface,  :

    ```bash
    fetchd query distribution rewards DELEGATOR_ADDRESS
    ```

You will need to replace `DELEGATOR_ADDRESS` with the actual address of the delegator whose rewards you want to query. For instance:

    ```bash
    fetchd query distribution rewards fetch15fn3meky8ktfry3qm73xkpjckzw4dazxpfx34m
    ```

This command will provide information about the rewards earned by the specified delegator, including details such as the validator addresses and the amount of rewards in different denominations. The output will be a list of rewards, each represented in a block of information. Below you can find an example output:

    ```text
    rewards:
    - validator_address: fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
      reward:
      - denom: atestfet
        amount: "0.000000000000200000"
    - validator_address: fetchvaloper1ysc8n5uspv4698nyk8u75lx98uu92zt7m3udw8
      reward:
      - denom: atestfet
        amount: "0.000000000001000000"
    total:
    - denom: atestfet
      amount: "0.000000000001200000"
    ```

In this example, the delegator at `DELEGATOR_ADDRESS` has earned rewards from two different validators on `dorado` test network. The rewards are listed in different denominations, such as `atestfet`.

You can also **filter rewards for a given validator**. For instance, you can filter rewards for `validator5` (`fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w`) as shown below:

    ```bash
    fetchd query distribution rewards fetch15fn3meky8ktfry3qm73xkpjckzw4dazxpfx34m fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
    ```

In the output, we get the rewards from this specific validator:

    ```text
    - denom: atestfet
      amount: "0.000000000000200000"
    ```

## Delegator operations

### How to delegate tokens

If you want to delegate `1000000 atestfet` tokens to  the `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w` validator from the account `myKey`, then you will need to use the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx staking delegate fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w 1000000atestfet --from myKey
    ```

This will require a confirmation before issuing a transaction. After the transaction gets processed, it should appear under the delegations of the `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w` validator.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Once delegated, tokens can only be _re-delegated_ to another validator, or _unbond_ in order to be returned to their original account. It is important to note that those two operations take **21 days to complete**, period in which the involved tokens will be unavailable.
    </Callout>

### Re-delegating tokens

**Re-delegating tokens allows you to transfer already delegated tokens from one validator to another**.

From the above example where you delegated `1000000 atestfet` to `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w`, you can now re-delegate parts or all of those tokens to another validator. For instance, you can re-delegate `400000 atestfet` from `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w` to `fetchvaloper122veneudkzyalay6gusvrhhpp0560mparpanvu` by running the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx staking redelegate fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w fetchvaloper122veneudkzyalay6gusvrhhpp0560mparpanvu 400000atestfet --from myKey
    ```

This will prompt for confirmation and issue a new transaction once accepted.

From here, if you inspect the delegations from our account, you will be able to see that your delegated tokens are now:

    - `600000atestfet` to validator `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w` (our initial 1000000 minus the 400000 re-delegated).
    - `400000atestfet` to validator `fetchvaloper122veneudkzyalay6gusvrhhpp0560mparpanvu`.

Now, those `400000 atestfet` you re-delegated can not be re-delegated anymore for 21 days (the exact date can be found by querying the re-delegation transaction, under the `completion_time` key).

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      It is still possible to unbond those tokens if needed.
    </Callout>

### How to unbond tokens

**Bonding** refers to the act of locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency tokens in a wallet or smart contract to participate in the network's consensus mechanism. These tokens are often referred to as the **stake**. Conversely, **unbonding** is the process of withdrawing or releasing the previously bonded tokens. When a user initiates an unbonding transaction, they are indicating that they want to take back their tokens from the staking mechanism.

You can transfer parts or all of our delegated tokens back to your account at any time by running the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx staking unbond fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w 300000atestfet --from myKey
    ```

Once again, this will prompt for confirmation and issue a transaction, initiating the transfer of `300000 atestfet` from our stake on `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w` validator address back to your account. Those tokens will then be available **after a 21 day period** (the exact date can be found by querying the re-delegation transaction, under the `completion_time` key).

### How to withdraw rewards

In order **to transfer rewards to the wallet**, run the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx distribution withdraw-rewards validator_address --from myKey
    ```

It requires the validator address from where the reward is withdrawn, and the name of the account private key having delegated tokens to the validator. For instance:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx distribution withdraw-rewards fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w --from myKey
    ```

You can **claim all rewards when you have delegated tokens to multiple validators**, by running the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx distribution withdraw-all-rewards --from myKey
    ```

The rewards will appear on the account as soon as the transaction is being processed.
