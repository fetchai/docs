## Querying the state

### How to query the current staking holdings of validators

The following command can be used to retrieve the current staking holdings of all validators:

    ```bash
    fetchd query staking validators
    ```

On `dorado` test network, this will produce an output similar to the following, describing the status of all the existing validators:

    ```text

      minselfdelegation: "1000000000000000000000"
      producingblocks: true
    ...
    ```

If you want to obtain the same information for a **single validator**, use the following command, by providing the `operatoraddress` of the validator:

    ```bash
    fetchd query staking validator fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
    ```

A delegator will be particularly interested in the following keys:

    - `commission/commission_rates/rate`: the commission rate on revenue charged to any delegator by the validator.
    - `commission/commission_rates/max_change_rate`: the maximum daily increase of the validator's commission. This parameter cannot be changed by the validator operator.
    - `commission/commission_rates/max_rate`: the maximum commission rate this validator can charge. This parameter cannot be changed by the validator operator.
    - `minselfdelegation`: minimum amount of `atestfet` the validator need to have bonded at all time. If the validator's self-bonded stake falls below this limit, their entire staking pool (i.e. all its delegators) will unbond. This parameter exists as a safeguard for delegators. Indeed, when a validator misbehaves, part of their total stake gets slashed. This includes the validator's self-delegateds stake as well as their delegators' stake. Thus, a validator with a high amount of self-delegated `atestfet` has more skin-in-the-game than a validator with a low amount. The minimum self-bond amount parameter guarantees to delegators that a validator will never fall below a certain amount of self-bonded stake, thereby ensuring a minimum level of skin-in-the-game. This parameter can only be increased by the validator operator.

### How to query the delegations made to a validator

From a validator address, we can **retrieve the list of delegations** it received:

    ```bash
    fetchd query staking delegations-to fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
    ```

Below is a sample of delegations `validator2` received on `dorado`:

    ```text
    - delegation:
        delegator_address: fetch1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t9zzruef
        validator_address: fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
        shares: "1000000000000000000000.000000000000000000"
      balance:
        denom: atestfet
        amount: "1000000000000000000000"
    - delegation:
        delegator_address: fetch15fn3meky8ktfry3qm73xkpjckzw4dazxpfx34m
        validator_address: fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
        shares: "100000.000000000000000000"
      balance:
        denom: atestfet
        amount: "100000"
    ```

### How to query the re-delegations

Delegators can choose to re-delegate the tokens they already delegated from one validator to another. Re-delegation takes effect immediately, without any waiting period. However, the tokens ca not be re-delegated until the initial re-delegation transaction has completed its 21 day completion time (the unlocking time is indicated by the `redelegationentry/completion_time` field in the outputs below).

To obtain the list of re-delegations made from a validator, use the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd query staking redelegations-from fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
    ```

This produces an output similar to the following, where delegator `fetch15fn3meky8ktfry3qm73xkpjckzw4dazxpfx34m` issued 2 re-delegations from `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w` to `fetchvaloper122veneudkzyalay6gusvrhhpp0560mparpanvu`:

    ```text
    fetchd query staking redelegations-from fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
    - redelegation:
        delegator_address: fetch15fn3meky8ktfry3qm73xkpjckzw4dazxpfx34m
        validator_src_address: fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
        validator_dst_address: fetchvaloper122veneudkzyalay6gusvrhhpp0560mparpanvu
        entries: []
      entries:
      - redelegationentry:
          creation_height: 291037
          completion_time: 2021-03-24T14:24:38.973444629Z
          initial_balance: "50000"
          shares_dst: "50000.000000000000000000"
        balance: "50000"
      - redelegationentry:
          creation_height: 291133
          completion_time: 2021-03-24T14:33:43.425472866Z
          initial_balance: "10000"
          shares_dst: "10000.000000000000000000"
        balance: "10000"
    ```

Similarly, the list of re-delegations issued by a delegator can be obtained with the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd query staking redelegations fetch15fn3meky8ktfry3qm73xkpjckzw4dazxpfx34m
    ```

### How to query the user rewards

After having delegated some tokens to a validator, the user is eligible to a share of the rewards the validator collects.

If you wish to **retrieve all the outstanding rewards for an address**, run the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd query distribution rewards fetch15fn3meky8ktfry3qm73xkpjckzw4dazxpfx34m
    ```

This will produce the following output, in which the address has delegated tokens to 2 validators on `dorado` test network:

    ```text
    rewards:
    - validator_address: fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
      reward:
      - denom: atestfet
        amount: "0.000000000000200000"
    - validator_address: fetchvaloper1ysc8n5uspv4698nyk8u75lx98uu92zt7m3udw8
      reward:
      - denom: atestfet
        amount: "0.000000000001000000"
    total:
    - denom: atestfet
      amount: "0.000000000001200000"
    ```

You can also **filter rewards for a given validator**. For instance, you can filter rewards for `validator5` as shown below:

    ```bash
    fetchd query distribution rewards fetch15fn3meky8ktfry3qm73xkpjckzw4dazxpfx34m fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w
    ```

We now get the reward from this specific validator:

    ```text
    - denom: atestfet
      amount: "0.000000000000200000"
    ```

## Delegator operations

### How to delegate tokens

If you want to delegate `1000000 atestfet` tokens to  the `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w` validator from the account `myKey`, then you will need to use the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx staking delegate fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w 1000000atestfet --from myKey
    ```

This will require a confirmation before issuing a transaction. After the transaction gets processed, it should appear under the delegations of the `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w` validator.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Once delegated, tokens can only be _re-delegated_ to another validator, or _unbond_ in order to be returned to their original account. It is important to note that those two operations take **21 days to complete**, period in which the involved tokens will be unavailable.
</Callout>

### Re-delegating tokens

**Re-delegating tokens allows you to transfer already delegated tokens from one validator to another**.

From the above example where we delegated `1000000 atestfet` to `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w`, we can now re-delegate parts or all of those tokens to another validator. For instance, we re-delegate `400000 atestfet` from `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w` to `fetchvaloper122veneudkzyalay6gusvrhhpp0560mparpanvu` by running the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx staking redelegate fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w fetchvaloper122veneudkzyalay6gusvrhhpp0560mparpanvu 400000atestfet --from myKey
    ```

This will prompt for confirmation and issue a new transaction once accepted.

From here, inspecting the delegations from our account, we will see that our delegated tokens are now:

    - `600000atestfet` to validator `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w` (our initial 1000000 minus the 400000 re-delegated).
    - `400000atestfet` to validator `fetchvaloper122veneudkzyalay6gusvrhhpp0560mparpanvu`.

Now, those `400000 atestfet` we redelegated can not be re-delegated anymore for 21 days (the exact date can be found by querying the re-delegation transaction, under the `completion_time` key).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  It is still possible to unbond those tokens if needed.
</Callout>

### How to unbond tokens

You can transfer parts or all of our delegated tokens back to our account at any time by running the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx staking unbond fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w 300000atestfet --from myKey
    ```

Once again, this will prompt for confirmation and issue a transaction, initiating the transfer of `300000 atestfet` from our stake on `fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w` validator back to our account. Those tokens will then be available **after a 21 day period** (the exact date can be found by querying the redelegation transaction, under the `completion_time` key).

### How to withdraw rewards

In order to transfer rewards to the wallet, the following command can be used:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx distribution withdraw-rewards fetchvaloper1z72rph6l5j6ex83n4urputykawcqg6t98xul2w --from myKey
    ```

It requires the validator address from where the reward is withdrawn, and the name of the account private key having delegated tokens to the validator.

You can claim all rewards, when you have delegated tokens to multiple validators, by running the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx distribution withdraw-all-rewards --from myKey
    ```

The rewards will appear on the account as soon as the transaction is being processed.
