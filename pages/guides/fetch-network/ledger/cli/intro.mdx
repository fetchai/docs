# CLI - Introduction üöÄ

The Command Line Interface (CLI) client provides all the capabilities for interacting with the [Fetch ledger ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/intro), such as creating addresses, sending transactions and the governance capabilities. Before starting with the Command Line client, you need to follow the [installation instructions ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/installation) for the Fetch Ledger.
