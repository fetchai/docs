# Multisig keys üîê

This feature of `fetchd` allows users to securely control keys in a number of configurations. This involves setting a minimum number of keys required to sign a transaction out of a maximum of N keys, known as a threshold number K.

## Creating a multisig key

To create a multisig key, use the following syntax:

    ```
    # Create a simple multisig key with a threshold of 1 as default
    fetchd keys add <multisig_key_name> --multisig <list_of_key_names>

    # Creating a multisig key with a higher threshold, K
    fetchd keys add <multisig_key_name> --multisig <list_of_key_names> --multisig-threshold <threshold integer K>
    ```

### Example instantiation of a multisig key: shared business multisig key

Consider a scenario in which three account holders need to collectively authorize transactions. At least two out of the three (K=2) must sign off on each transaction:

    ```
    # Create the three keys owned by the separate account holders
    fetchd keys add fred
    fetchd keys add ted
    fetchd keys add ned

    # Create the multisig key from keys above
    fetchd keys add business_key --multisig fred,ted,ned --multisig-threshold 2
    ```

Importantly, remember to retrieve the address of `business_key` for future use:

    ```
    fetchd keys show -a business_key
    ```

## Signing and broadcasting multisig transactions

Transactions must be signed and broadcasted before they can be executed.

In order to sign a multi signature transaction, the transaction itself must not be immediately broadcast. Instead, the key holders must each sign until a minimum threshold K signatures are present.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  For this example, we will be performing the transaction on the [Dorado ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://explore-dorado.fetch.ai/) network and therefore will be using `atestfet` as the denomination, and a gas price of 1000000000atestfet (this should be changed depending on the actual currency and network used).

### Example: Multisig transaction

    ```
    # Create a key to represent a vendor that the business must pay
    fetchd keys add vendor

    # Generate a transaction as an output file to be signed by
    # the keyholders, 'ted' and 'fred' in this example
    fetchd tx bank send <business_key address> <vendor address> 1000atestfet --gas 90000 --gas-prices 1000000000atestfet --generate-only > transfer.json

    # you'll get "account <address of business_key> not found" error for missing funds
    # add funds to <address of business_key> using block explorer or by eg
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"address":"<address of business_key>"}' https://faucet-dorado.fetch.ai/api/v3/claims

    # This transaction file (transfer.json) is then made available for
    # the first keyholder to sign, 'fred'
    fetchd tx sign transfer.json --chain-id dorado-1 --from fred --multisig <address of business_key> > transfer_fredsigned.json

    # This is repeated for 'ted'
    fetchd tx sign transfer.json --chain-id dorado-1 --from ted --multisig <address of business_key> > transfer_tedsigned.json

    # These two files are then collated together and used as inputs to the
    # multisign command to create a fully signed transaction
    fetchd tx multisign transfer.json business_key transfer_fredsigned.json transfer_tedsigned.json > signed_transfer.json

    # Now that the transaction is fully signed, it may be broadcast
    fetchd tx broadcast signed_transfer.json

    # Now display the result of the transaction and confirm that the vendor has
    # received payment
    fetchd query bank balances <address of vendor>
    ```

It is important to note that this method of signing transactions can apply to all types of transaction, including staking and withdrawal transactions as shown below.

### Other multisig transaction examples

Other examples are provided below:

    ```
    # In order to create a staking transaction using a multisig key
    # the same process as above can be used with the output file of this command
    fetchd tx staking delegate <fetchvaloper address> 10000atestfet --from <address of business_key> --gas 200000 --gas-prices 1000000000atestfet --generate-only > stake.json

    # The following command can also be used to create a withdrawal transaction for the
    # rewards from staking when using a multisig key - this too must be signed as before
    fetchd tx distribution withdraw-all-rewards --from <address of business_key> --gas 150000 --gas-prices 1000000000atestfet --generate-only > withdrawal.json
    ```
