# How to use the token faucet üí∞

## Introduction

A token faucet is a service or tool that provides free tokens or cryptocurrency to users for testing or development purposes on a blockchain network. It helps developers and users access a blockchain's test network with a small amount of cryptocurrency without having to purchase it. This allows them to interact with the blockchain, test applications, and simulate real-world scenarios without using actual funds. It is a valuable resource for developers who want to experiment with blockchain applications in a risk-free environment.

For our [test networks ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/fetch-network/ledger/active-networks#test-nets), we have a simple token faucet implemented to allow users to get started quickly. You can send it an account address, and it will transfer some test tokens back to it.

Token Faucets are network specific, depending on the network type they may or may not be deployed. Please check the [networks ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/ledger/active-networks) page for specific details.

The token faucet itself is available from the network [block explorer](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/block-explorer) page by clicking on the **GET FUNDS** button available on the in the explorer homepage. By clicking on this button, you will be asked to enter your Fetch Account address (`fetch...`) in the pop-up window and click the **Add Funds** button afterwards. You will have to wait a few blocks for the transaction to be processed, and you should see it appearing alongside with some funds on your account.

## How to add funds to wallet using faucet APIs

You can also request and get testnet tokens in your wallet using the APIs, by running the following commands:

### Get atestfet

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"address":"<address>"}' https://faucet-dorado.fetch.ai/api/v3/claims
    ```

### Get nanomobx

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"address":"<address>"}' https://faucet-mobx-dorado.fetch.ai/api/v3/claims
    ```

### Get ulrn

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"address":"<address>"}' https://faucet-lrn-dorado.fetch.ai/api/v3/claims
    ```

### Sample response for fund request to faucet

    ```text
    {"status":"ok","uuid":"<uuid>","target":"<address>"}
    ```

### Check the wallet balance

    ```bash
    fetchd query bank balances <address>
    ```

The output would be:

    ```text
    balances:
    - amount: "<balance>"
      denom: atestfet
    pagination:
      next_key: null
      total: "0"
    ```
