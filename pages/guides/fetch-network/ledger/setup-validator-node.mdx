# How to set up a validator node üåê

## Pre-requisites

First of all, you need to have:

    - [installed ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/installation) `fetchd`.
    - [Configured and connected ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/joining-testnet) your validator to the desired network.

Also, it would be beneficial if you also explore the [CLI documentation ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/intro) to understand how to correctly interact with the Fetch Ledger.

## Creating a validator

If you wish to create a validator, you will need to send a transaction to the network to stake your FET tokens. This process registers you as a validator, and if you are one of the chosen validators, you will start to produce blocks. If you want to create a validator using `fetchd` [Command Line Interface (CLI) ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/intro) you will need to send a `create-validator` transaction to the network as shown below:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx staking create-validator \
      --amount=<the amount to bond> \
      --pubkey=$(fetchd tendermint show-validator) \
      --moniker="choose a moniker" \
      --chain-id=<chain_id> \
      --commission-rate="0.10" \
      --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
      --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
      --min-self-delegation="<the min self delegation>" \
      --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5 --gas-prices "<network gas prices>" \
      --from=<key_name>
    ```

**Dorado example**

You should verify that you have some tokens available before trying to create a validator. The easiest way to do this is via the [CLI ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/tokens). Below, you can find an example of a typical CLI command that registers the node as running the validator:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx staking create-validator \
      --amount=1000000000000000000atestfet \
      --pubkey=$(fetchd tendermint show-validator) \
      --moniker="my-test-validator" \
      --chain-id=dorado-1 \
      --commission-rate="0.10" \
      --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
      --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
      --min-self-delegation="1000000000000000000" \
      --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5 --gas-prices 1000000000atestfet \
      --from=test-key
    ```

## Edit a validator configuration

It is possible that validators will need to adjust various settings about their nodes over the time.
This can be _simple things_, such as the associated website for a validator, or _more consequential actions_, like altering the commission rate. In either case, should a validator choose to make this update they would send an `edit-validator` transaction to the network.

These transactions can be created in a similar way to the `create-validator` transaction depicted above:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx staking edit-validator
      --moniker="choose a moniker" \
      --website="https://fetch.ai" \
      --details="To infinity and beyond!" \
      --chain-id=<chain_id> \
      --commission-rate="0.10" \
      --from=<key_name>
    ```

## Unbonding a validator

Whenever and if a validator wants to stop being a validator for any reason, they can unbond some or all of their staked tokens. **Unbonding refers to the process of withdrawing or removing a certain amount of staked tokens from a validator or a network after a defined waiting period**.

This operation is carried out with the following CLI command:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx staking unbond \
      <validator operator address> \
      <amount to remove> \
      --from <key name>
    ```

An instance of this command is given in the example below:

    ```bash
    fetchd tx staking unbond \
      fetchvaloper1jqqwdch3jmzlmj4tjfn67s3sqm9elkd3wrpspf \
      1000000000000000000000atestfet \
      --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5 --gas-prices 1000000000atestfet \
      --from test-key
    ```
