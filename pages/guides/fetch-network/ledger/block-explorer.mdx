# How to use the block explorer üîé

## Introduction

A block explorer is a web-based tool that offers a visual interface for interacting with a blockchain network. It enables users to view details about individual blocks, explore transactions, check wallet balances and histories, verify transaction statuses, and access network statistics. Additionally, it provides real-time or historical data on network activity and offers insights into smart contract interactions for platforms with this capability. Block explorers are essential for users, developers, and researchers to easily access and comprehend blockchain data, enhancing transparency and accessibility.

Each of the available Fetch [networks ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/fetch-network/ledger/active-networks) has a dedicated block explorer website associated with it.

## Logging in with the ledger nano

The Ledger Nano is a hardware wallet designed to provide a secure and convenient way to store and manage cryptocurrencies. It is a physical device, similar in appearance to a USB drive, that is used to securely store the private keys necessary for accessing and managing cryptocurrency holdings. To log in with you ledger nano device:

1. Navigate towards the block explorer landing page.
2. Click on the key button (üîë) in the top right corner of the block explorer landing page.
3. At this point, you will be prompted to a _sign in with ledger_ page using either USB or bluetooth connection.
4. Now, **accept this request on your ledger nano device**.
5. After completing this process, the key button will be replaced by a person icon with a link to your personal address page, which keeps track of the activity that you have performed on the testnet.

## Getting testnet tokens from the faucet

For networks that support it, you can obtain tokens for your account in the following way:

 1. Copy your account's address and paste it into the [token faucet ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/faucet).
 2. Then, return to the **main page**, and press the **Get Funds** button.
 3. Paste your address in the pop-up window.
 4. You can now return to your address page, via the person icon, and should see that you have been allocated **1 TESTFET**.

## Transferring tokens to another address

After receiving tokens, you can send these tokens to another address using the purple **Transfer** button on your address page. This will trigger a pop-up window that prompts you to specify the destination address and the amount of tokens you wish to transfer. After filling in this information, you will be asked to sign the transaction using your ledger nano device. The transaction confirmation gives two links that can be used to check that the transaction has been executed on the blockchain using either the transaction hash or your account page.

## Delegating stake to a validator

Within the block explorer landing page, you can delegate your tokens to a validator which is operating on the network by clicking on the **Validators** tab, and selecting one of the validators that you wish to delegate stake towards. By clicking on a validator name, you will be redirected towards that validator's details.
