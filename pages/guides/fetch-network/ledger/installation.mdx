# Installation üõ†

## Prerequisites

You can start using the ledger by first having installed what follows:

    - **Go 1.18+**: installation instructions are available [here ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://golang.org/dl/).
    - **Packages**: `make`, `gcc` (on Ubuntu, install them with `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y make gcc`).

## Building the code

Download the latest released version from GitHub and build the project using the running the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/fetchai/fetchd.git && cd fetchd
    ```

Then, **build the code** by running the following command:

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

This will generate the `./build/fetchd` binary.

For non-developer users we recommend that the user installs the binaries into their system. This can be done with the following command:

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

This will install the binaries in the directory specified by your `$GOBIN` environment variable (default to `~/go/bin`).

    ```bash
    which fetchd
    ```

This should return a path such as `~/go/bin/fetchd` (might be different depending on your actual **Go** installation).

  If you get no output, or an error such as `which: no fetchd in ...`, possible cause can either be that `make install` failed with some errors or that your go binary folder (default: ~/go/bin) is not in your `PATH`.

  To add the ~/go/bin folder to your PATH, add this line at the end of your ~/.bashrc:

  ```
  export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
  ```

  and reload it with:

  ```
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```
</Callout>

You can also **verify that you are running the correct version** by running the following command:

    ```bash
    fetchd version
    ```

This would print a version number that must be compatible with the network you are connecting to. See the [network page ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/fetch-network/ledger/active-networks) for the list of supported versions per available network.

### FAQ

<Callout type="error" emoji="Ô∏èüö´">
  Error: failed to parse log level (main:info,state:info,:error): Unknown Level String: 'main:info,state:info,:error', defaulting to NoLevel.
</Callout>

This means that **you had a pre-stargate version of `fetchd` (‚â§ v0.7.x), and that you have just installed another stargate version (‚â• v0.8.x)**. To solve the issue, you will need to remove the previous configuration files with the following:

    ```bash
    rm ~/.fetchd/config/app.toml ~/.fetchd/config/config.toml
    ```
