# Agent Network Hub

## Introduction

Within the ASI Network, an essential tool is the **Agent Network Hub** which works similarly to any block explorer, thus offering the opportunity for users to navigate and analyze the Fetch.ai blockchain network data and related information. 

You can access the Agent Network Hub [here ↗️](https://companion.fetch.ai/fetchhub-4/blocks).

Overall, an explorer provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and tracking on-chain activities, including transactions, blocks, smart contracts, wallet addresses and so on.  By allowing users to search for and verify blockchain data, a block explorer serves as an essential resource for developers, researchers, and anyone looking to understand the workings of a blockchain ecosystem. 

## Agent Network Hub Functionalities

### Blocks Page

The **Blocks** page of the Agent Network Hub UI provides a detailed breakdown of each specific block, making it easy for users to analyze individual transactions and understand the context of on-chain activities. It is useful for developers, network validators, and anyone looking to verify or trace transactions on the blockchain.

The Block Summary provides a high-level overview of recent network activity, including:

- **Block Height**: it indicates the latest block number on the blockchain.
- **Block Count (last 24h)**: it shows the number of blocks created in the past 24 hours.
- **Transaction Count (last 24h)**: it displays the total number of transactions processed in the last 24 hours.
- **Block Time**: it is the average time it takes to create a new block, measured in seconds.

On the other hand, the _Recent Blocks_ section provides a table that lists the most recent blocks added to the blockchain, thus making it easy for users to track historical block data. The page offers multiple data details, including:

- **Block Number (Hash)**: it displays the unique block number and its associated hash. Clicking on the block number or hash may lead to a detailed block view.
- **Created At**: it is the timestamp when the block was created, along with how long ago it occurred.
- **Proposer**: it is the validator that proposed the block. Validators' names (e.g., Kiln, Altruistic Automaton, Blockscope.net) are shown alongside their icons or logos.
- **Transaction Count (Tx count)**: it is the number of transactions included within each block.

You can click on a specific Block, you can enter the _Block Details_ page. This page provides in-depth information about the specific block on the blockchain:
