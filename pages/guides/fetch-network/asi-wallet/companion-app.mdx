# ASI Wallet Companion App

## Introduction

Within the ASI Network, an essential tool is the **Companion App** which works similarly to any block explorer, thus offering the opportunity for users to navigate and analyze the Fetch.ai blockchain network data and related information. 

You can access the Companion App [here ↗️](https://companion.fetch.ai/fetchhub-4/blocks).

Overall, an explorer provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and tracking on-chain activities, including transactions, blocks, smart contracts, wallet addresses and so on.  By allowing users to search for and verify blockchain data, a block explorer serves as an essential resource for developers, researchers, and anyone looking to understand the workings of a blockchain ecosystem. 

## Companion App Functionalities

### Blocks Page

The **Blocks** page of the Companion App UI provides a detailed breakdown of each specific block, making it easy for users to analyze individual transactions and understand the context of on-chain activities. It is useful for developers, network validators, and anyone looking to verify or trace transactions on the blockchain.
