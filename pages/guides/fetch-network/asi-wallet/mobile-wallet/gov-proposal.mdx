# How to use ASI Alliance Wallet

## Feature - Gov Proposal

Governance proposal is a system for managing and implementing changes to cryptocurrency blockchains. In this type of governance, voting systems for instituting changes are programmed into the blockchain. Developers propose changes, and each stakeholder votes on whether to accept or reject the proposed change. Blockchain stakeholders might be developers, validators, token holders, or anyone else the blockchain is designed to include.

    - Open ASI Alliance Wallet Dashboard.
    - Navigate to **More Tab**.
    - Look for and select the **Proposals** option.
