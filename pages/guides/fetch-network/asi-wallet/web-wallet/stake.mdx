### Stake Dashboard

    1. By clicking on the **Stake** icon, users are redirected to the **Stake Dashboard** where they can see their available, staked, and claimable amounts. The dashboard also contains a list of validators in which users have staked.
    2. The **Stake more** button allows users to stake with a variety of other validators. For a detailed walk - through, refer to **Stake Functions** .

    4. **Staked balances** provide an overview of staked tokens amounts.

### Stake Functions

1. The dashboard view is dynamic, appearing differently when the user hasn't staked yet. In this case, the user will see **Start Staking** or **Stake More**, both of which perform the same function. Clicking the button redirects to the **Validators List**, where users can filter validators by **APR**, **Voting Power**, and **Name**.

2. Clicking on any validator box will redirect you to its details page; this allows the user to proceed with staking by providing the necessary transaction information. Once the transaction is completed, it will be displayed on the staking dashboard.
