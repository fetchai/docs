# Querying Balances üîç

Once you have established a [connection to a network node ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/CosmPy/EstablishingNodeConnection.md), you can use the `LegderClient` object to perform many useful operations, such as _querying balances_. In particular the `LedgerClient` object allows you to:

1. Query all balances associated with a _particular address_.
2. Query all balances associated with a _particular denomination_.

Let's explore how to achieve both. We will start by importing CosmPy as well as the relevant modules. We will then connect to the chain we want to perform the query on. Once connected, we will specify the address we want to query. In our example we will connect to the Fetch.ai Mainnet and we will query all balances associated with a particular address.

```py copy 
import cosmpy
from cosmpy.aerial.client import LedgerClient, NetworkConfig

ledger_client = LedgerClient(NetworkConfig.fetch_mainnet())

address: str = 'fetch12q5gw9l9d0yyq2th77x6pjsesczpsly8h5089x'
balances = ledger_client.query_bank_all_balances(address)
print(balances)
```

Querying all balances associated with a particular address returns a `List` of `Coin` objects that contain `amount` and `denom` variables that correspond to all the funds held at the address and their denominations. This list includes all natively defined coins along with any tokens transferred using the inter-blockchain communication [IBC ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://ibcprotocol.org/) protocol. Once successful, you will see the following input in the terminal:

```py copy
[Coin(amount='1616060698998992698400', denom='afet'), Coin(amount='10', denom='ibc/605C5B80A8253543F8038F96F56BA13BDD8D300E12F1B32A3FA2E1EB2A933FA1'), Coin(amount='5000000', denom='ibc/B58E6786772640EC4B538AFC4393F742C326734B74CCAFAFBF7EFDC7D435B428')]
```

In order to query all balances associated with a particular denomination we can run the same script but substitute the final balance command with:

```py 
balance = ledger_client.query_bank_balance(address, denom='afet')
```

This will return the value of the (integer) funds held by the address with the specified
denomination. If the `denom` argument is omitted the function will return the fee denomination specified in the `NetworkConfig` object used to initialize the `LedgerClient`.
