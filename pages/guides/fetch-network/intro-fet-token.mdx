# Getting Started with FET Token

## Introduction

The FET token is the backbone of the **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance**, uniting **Fetch.ai**, **Ocean Protocol**, and **SingularityNET** into a cohesive ecosystem. As the result of a landmark token merger involving **FET**, **OCEAN**, and **AGIX**, FET now serves as a unified utility token that drives decentralized AI services, governance, and computational resources within this groundbreaking Alliance.

Whether enabling microtransactions for autonomous [Agents ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/whats-an-agent), supporting network operations through staking, or unlocking access to AI tools, the FET token plays a central role into advancing the infrastructure of decentralized AI functionalities. This guide works as a comprehensive resource to understand, acquire, and effectively utilize FET tokens. Let's embark on the journey into the future of AI-powered autonomy and innovation!

## Understanding the FET token

The FET token plays a vital role in enabling an agent-driven future on the Fetch.ai mainnet and within the broader ASI ecosystem. 

Here are the FET token key use cases:

### Network operations

- **Staking**: You can use FET tokens to secure the Fetch.ai Mainnet by staking FET tokens.
- **Governance**: You can use FET tokens to participate in decentralized governance decisions.

### Agent-based systems

- **Agent Registration**: You can use FET tokens to register autonomous Agents to the broader network of Agents and [Functions ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-functions).
- **Interactions**: You can use FET to enable interactions between Agents in the broader ecosystem.

### Decentralized transactions and AI marketplace access

- **Micropayments**: You can use FET tokens to support low-cost micropayments and smart contract interactions across the network.
- **Tools and Resources**: You can use FET tokens to access AI tools, datasets, and compute resources using FET tokens.

## Acquiring FET Tokens

### Step 1: Set up a secure wallet

Before acquiring any FET tokens, you wil first need to create an ASI Alliance Wallet to safely store your FET tokens in one place. Follow the [official wallet setup guide ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/asi-wallet/web-wallet/get-started) to ensure security and compatibility with the Fetch.ai ecosystem. You can also download the ASI Wallet on your Mobile. Follow this guide [here ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/asi-wallet/mobile-wallet/get-started) for an improved overview on how to achieve this.

### Step 2: Purchase FET tokens

FET tokens can be purchased from trusted exchanges. You can purchase tokens from either:

- **Centralized Exchanges (CEX)**: Such as Binance or MEXC; or,
- **Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)**: Such as _Osmosis_.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      It is important for you to know that setting up an account on a Centralized Exchanges requires you to complete a **Know Your Customer (KYC)** step to correctly set up your account. Ensure you're using a secure and trusted and verified platform to avoid any issues.

### Step 3: Transfer FET tokens to your wallet

Once you purchase FET tokens, you can easily transfer them from the exchange of your choice to your ASI Wallet via the Fetch.ai network. 

**Native FET tokens** are specifically designed for the Fetch.ai ecosystem, enabling seamless transactions, Agent interactions, and access to decentralized services. If an exchange only supports **ERC-20 FET tokens** (i.e., compatible with the Ethereum network), you can easily convert them to native FET using the Fetch.ai token bridge. Check out the following guides for a better understanding: [How to convert native FET to and from ERC-20 FET ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/how-to-convert-fet-to-and-from-erc20).

By converting ERC-20 FET tokens via the Token Bridge, you ensure that your ERC-20 tokens are fully compatible with the Fetch.ai network, and are ready for use.

### Securely store and make transactions with FET tokens

#### Send FET tokens

1. Open your ASI Alliance Wallet. 
2. Enter the recipient's wallet address and the amount of tokens you wish to send 
3. Double-check the details and confirm the transaction.

Check out these guides for a better understanding:

  - [How to use ASI Alliance Web Wallet - Send/Receive ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/asi-wallet/web-wallet/send-receive)

#### Store FET tokens

For short-term storage goals, the ASI Wallet is an excellent choice; it provides direct functionalities for daily activities such as staking and interacting with Agents. 

For long-term storage goals, you can enhance security by integrating your ASI Wallet with a hardware wallet like Ledger, offering robust protection for your assets. Follow this guide [here ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/asi-wallet/asi-wallet-hardware-connection-guide) if you wish to set up the ASI Alliance extension wallet with a Ledger hardware wallet.

#### Verify transactions

you can use Mintscan by entering the transaction hash to track their status. Alternatively, the ASI Wallet itself provides a detailed transaction history, allowing you to review and confirm your activities directly within the app. Head over to these guides to understand how to check the activity and operations undertaken within your ASI Alliance wallet, encompassing transfers, staking, re-delegation and overall interactions:

      **Best Practices for Managing FET Tokens**
    
        - **Test transfers**: Always start with a small test transaction to ensure accuracy.
        - **Secure your wallet**: Keep your wallet updated and protect your private key and seed phrase—never share them.
        - **Verify transaction details**: Double-check addresses, networks, and token types before sending tokens.
        - **Track transactions**: Use tools like Mintscan to confirm and monitor transfers.

      By following these steps, you will ensure secure and smooth token management operations and transactions.

### How to transfer tokens to your Agents

You can download and use the uAgents library to create autonomous Agents capable of interacting with other Agents in a decentralized environment. Check out this guide [here ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/installing-uagent) to get started with Agents development.

In order to get your Agent up and running within the Fetch.ai ecosystem, you will need to retrieve the Agent's address and fund it with FET tokens to make it correctly register within the network. For detailed instructions on obtaining an Agent's address, refer to the official guide [here ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/getting-uagent-address).

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      When creating your account, it is crucial to securely store your private key and Agent's address. Most importantly, safeguard your [seed phrase ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/seedphrase). The seed phrase is essential for accessing your Agent's identity and controlling any funds it holds. Treat it with the highest level of security to prevent unauthorized access!
    </Callout>

#### Example: Retrieving an Agent address and balance

The following Python script demonstrates how to create and initialize an Agent using the `uagents` and `cosmpy` libraries, to connect it to the Fetch.ai Mainnet, and retrieve its address and balance information:

    ```py copy filename="agent_address_and_balance.py"
    from uagents import Agent, Context
    import cosmpy
    
    from cosmpy.aerial.client import LedgerClient, NetworkConfig
    
    agent = Agent(name="alice", seed="", port=8000, test=False,  endpoint=["http://localhost:8000/submit"])
    
    @agent.on_event("startup")
    async def introduce_agent(ctx: Context):
        ctx.logger.info(f"ASI network address:{agent.wallet.address()}")
        ledger_client = LedgerClient(NetworkConfig.fetch_mainnet())
        address: str = agent.wallet.address()
        balances = ledger_client.query_bank_all_balances(address)
        ctx.logger.info(f"Balance of addr: {balances}")
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent.run()
    
    ```

The Agent named `alice` is initialized with a specified `name`, `port`, `endpoint`, and `seed` parameters. When the Agent starts up, it logs the wallet address and queries the balance using the `LedgerClient` connected to the Fetch.ai Mainnet. Finally, the script runs the Agent, which processes the `startup` event and retrieves the balance, allowing the Agent to interact with the Fetch.ai network.

Once you run the above Agent script, you will see your Agent address and balance printed out. You will see somthing similar to the following output:

    ```
    INFO:     [alice]: Registration on Almanac API successful
    INFO:     [alice]: Registering on almanac contract...
    INFO:     [alice]: Registering on almanac contract...complete
    INFO:     [alice]: Agent inspector available at https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8000&address=agent1qdxdrwqek4pt9xt8kggcxus0zm54d4vgdznrs6y5acn26paphervwfj7pdd
    INFO:     [alice]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    INFO:     [alice]: ASI network address:fetch1ujr7wyuvza7uwnkr3usv53hjlwjvu8s7l06vzf
    INFO:     [alice]: Balance of addr: []
    ```

You can now use this address to transfer your purchased FET tokens from the exchange to this Agent's address. This should be as simple as withdrawing native FET, by selecting the Fetch.ai Mainnet network when withdrawing.
