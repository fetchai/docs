# Getting test tokens

Test tokens are used for testing purposes in blockchain environments. They are not real cryptocurrency and have no monetary value. Instead, they are used to simulate transactions and interactions on a blockchain network for testing and development purposes. Test tokens allow developers to experiment with smart contracts, test decentralized applications (dApps), and ensure the proper functioning of the network without the risk of using real assets. They are typically provided through faucets, which are tools or interfaces that dispense these test tokens to users for testing on specific blockchain networks.

For our [test networks ↗️](/references/fetch-network/ledger/active-networks#test-nets), we have a simple token faucet implemented to allow users to get started quickly. You can send it an account address, and it will transfer some test tokens back to it. Token Faucets are network specific, depending on the network type they may or may not be deployed.
