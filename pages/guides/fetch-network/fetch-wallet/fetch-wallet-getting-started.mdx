# Fetch wallet 💵

## Getting started 🎯

The **Fetch Wallet**, originally forked from the [Kepl ↗️](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet)wallet, is a wallet for interacting with the Fetch blockchain network and other ledgers built using the Cosmos-SDK ecosystem, and supports the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.

Some of its highlights include:

    - Private keys and mnemonics are encrypted (using scrypt) and are stored locally on device. This means neither Fetch nor the websites visited have access to these sensitive data.
    - Multiple accounts on the Fetch ledger and other Cosmos-based ledgers.
    - Support for Ledger hardware wallets for enhanced security.
    - Native and IBC token transfers.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      IBC, or Inter-Blockchain Communication, is a protocol designed to facilitate communication and the transfer of digital assets and data between different blockchain networks. It enables interoperability, allowing separate blockchains to interact with one another.

## Compatibility

The Fetch Wallet works on all Chromium-based web browsers, including [Chrome ↗️](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Brave ↗️](https://brave.com/), [Edge ↗️](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) and [Decentr ↗️](https://decentr.net/).

## Get the wallet

You can directly install the Fetch wallet from the [Chrome web store ↗️](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fetchai-network-wallet/ellkdbaphhldpeajbepobaecooaoafpg/related?hl=en-GB).

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      At this time, you cannot run the [Keplr ↗️](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en) and Fetch wallets together because they interfere. Please disable the Keplr wallet before using the Fetch wallet.

## Version

## Set up

After opening the wallet for the first time, you will see the following options:

    1. Create a new account.
    2. Import an existing account.
    3. Connect your ledger hardware wallet.
    4. Migrate from ETH.

### Create a new account

1. Select **Create new account**.
2. Backup your mnemonic seed securely.

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      KEEP IT SAFE! Anyone with your mnemonic seed can access your wallet and take your assets.

      DON'T LOSE IT! Lost mnemonic seed cannot be recovered! If you lose your mnemonic seed you will lose access to your wallet!
    </Callout>

3. Give your account a name and set a password. This password will be used the next time you want to use the wallet or make important changes to your account.
4. Rearrange the mnemonic phrases by clicking on them in the correct order to confirm your mnemonic seed.

### Import an existing account

If you have an account on the Fetch network (e.g., having had one already on the Fetch wallet and want to access it again, have an account on another wallet and wish to bring it to the Fetch wallet, or having created an address using one of our tools), you can import it into the Fetch wallet in the following way:

1. First of all, you need to select **Import existing account**.
2. Then you need to enter your mnemonic seed (set of words) or private key (hexadecimal)

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      KEEP IT SAFE! Anyone with your mnemonic seed or private key can access your wallet and take your assets.
    </Callout>

3. Lastly, you need to give your account a name and set a password. This password will be used the next time you want to use the wallet or make important changes to your account.

### Use ledger hardware wallet

If you have a ledger hardware wallet and wish to keep your key and mnemonics on that device while using the Fetch wallet:

1. You need to select **Import ledger**.
2. You need to give your account a name and set a password. This password will be used the next time you want to use the wallet or make important changes to your account.
3. Follow the instructions on the popup to connect your device.

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      Please ensure you keep your mnemonic seed somewhere safe where others cannot access it. If you lose it, your wallet will be inaccessible once you log out. The password for your account should also be kept safe but is not necessary for recovery if you have your mnemonic seed.
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      If you lose your password, you need to uninstall and re-install the Fetch wallet and select **Import existing account**. Then use the mnemonic seed for your account and choose a new password.
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      Currently, only [ledger hardware wallets ↗️](https://www.ledger.com/) are supported.
    </Callout>

### Migrate from ETH

Prior to the transition to our native Cosmos SDK-based ledger, [ERC-20 FET ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/native-and-erc20-fet-tokens) staked using accounts on Ethereum were migrated to native accounts on the Fetch main network. These accounts correspond to the private key of their associated Ethereum accounts.

These native accounts can be accessed by transforming the original Ethereum keypair into a native Fetch keypair and address:

    1. Click **Migrate from ETH**.
    2. Click **Migrate a Metamask Private Key**.
    3. Enter the address and private key of the Ethereum account which staked ERC-20 FETs.
    4. Give your account a name and set a password if one is not set (i.e. if it is the first time you open the wallet, or in case you have removed all of your accounts). The password will be used the next time you want to use the wallet or make important changes to your account. Hit **Next**.

## Other operations

### Switching accounts

If you have multiple accounts set up on the Fetch wallet, to switch between them:

    1. First of all, ensure you are logged into the wallet correctly.
    2. Click the account icon in the top right corner of the dashboard.
    3. Then, select the account you want to switch to.

### Removing accounts

If you want to remove an account from your Fetch wallet:

    1. Ensure you are logged into the wallet.
    2. Click the account icon in the top right corner of the dashboard.
    3. Hit the three dots icon for the account you want to remove and choose **Delete Account**.
    4. Enter your wallet password.

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      If you have not yet backed up your mnemonic seed, click on **Back-up account** and enter you password to view it.
      Then **back it up safely**. If you lose your mnemonic seed you will lose access to your account!
    </Callout>

5. Lastly, click on **Confirm** to remove the account from your wallet.
