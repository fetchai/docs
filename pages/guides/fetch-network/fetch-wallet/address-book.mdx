    1. From the wallet dashboard click the ☰ icon in the top left, then **Address book**.
    2. Select the network this address belongs to, then **+ Add New**.
    4. Fill in the details:

        - **Name**: the name you give to this account.
        - **Address**: the account's address.
        - **Default memo**: the memo used by default when sending funds to this account.

    5. Click on **Save**.

        <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
          When sending funds, instead of writing the address of the recipient you can hit the icon to the right to select an account from the address book.
