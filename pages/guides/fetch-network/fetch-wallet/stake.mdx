# How to stake using the Fetch wallet

Clicking the **Stake** button on the Fetch wallet dashboard opens the Fetch [ledger browser ↗️](https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/validators). From here, you can [connect your wallet ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/fetch-wallet/connections) and stake your FETs. To learn how, follow the [staking guide ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/how-to-stake) and [ways of staking FET tokens ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/different-ways-to-stake-the-fet-token) guide.

## Claim rewards

If your account has any tokens staked, you can withdraw your rewards from the wallet: 

1. Ensure you are logged into the wallet.
2. From the wallet dashboard, select **Claim**.

3. The wallet shows you a summary of the transaction. Review it, select a transaction fee, and if you are happy, hit **Approve** to complete the operation.

You should now see the rewards added to your **Total Balance**.
