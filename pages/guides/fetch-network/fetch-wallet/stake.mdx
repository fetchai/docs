# How to stake and claim rewards

You can learn how to stake your tokens by following the [How to stake FET ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/how-to-stake) and [Different ways of staking FET tokens ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/different-ways-to-stake-the-fet-token) guides available within our documentation.

## Claiming rewards

If your account has tokens staked, you can withdraw your rewards directly from the wallet:

    1. Ensure you are logged into the wallet.
    2. From the wallet dashboard, select **Claim**.

          This will claim the total rewards accrued for your stakes across every validator.
        </Callout>

    3. The wallet shows you a summary of the transaction. Review it, select a transaction fee, and if you are happy, hit **Approve** to complete the operation.

    You should now see the rewards added to your **Total Balance**.

          If you want to claim rewards from each validator individually, see the [Claim rewards using the staking dashboard ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/how-to-stake).
