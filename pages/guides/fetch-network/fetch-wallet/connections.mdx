# Connections

Some webpages can connect to your wallet and enable interactions that are otherwise not possible. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  By default, the [fetch ledger browser ↗️](https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/validators) only shows a list of active validators for the Fetch network along with some staking-related details (e.g. the validators' commission rates and number of delegated FETs). However if you have your wallet set up on the browser, you will see a button for connecting your wallet in the top right of the page, and if you do, you will get the option of staking your FETs with any of the validators on the list and accessing your staking dashboard. To learn more, visit the [staking guide ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/how-to-stake) and [ways of staking FET tokens ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/different-ways-to-stake-the-fet-token) guide.
</Callout>

If you view such webpages using a browser with the Fetch wallet, you will see additional options.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
If you use a browser with no wallet, those options will not be shown.
</Callout>

You can manage these connections on the wallet:

1. From the wallet dashboard, click the ☰ icon in the top left, then **Settings**.
2. Click on **Manage Connections**.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Here, you will see a list of webpages which have been connected to your wallet. Visiting these pages will not ask you for a connection with your wallet again; the page will automatically connect.

  You have the option of removing and thus revoking these connections. If you do, the next time you visit that page, it will not automatically connect to your wallet.
</Callout>

3. To remove a connection, click the ✖ ️icon on the connection you wish to remove.
