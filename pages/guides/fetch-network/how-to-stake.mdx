# How to stake FET

On this page, you can find instructions on how to stake FET, remove your stake, and claim your staking rewards.
Additional information on different ways to stake FET tokens can be found [here ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/different-ways-to-stake-the-fet-token).

## Stake

1. Ensure you are logged into your [Fetch wallet ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/fetch-wallet/fetch-wallet-getting-started).
2. On the wallet dashboard, select **Stake**. You should be redirected to the [ledger browser](https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/validators).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Here, you will find a list of every active [validator ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/validators) with whom you can stake your FETs. You can also see the amount of FET staked to each validator and their commission rates.

  The validators on this page are ordered according to the number of FETs delegated to them and not their reputation or benefits. See [choosing a validator](/guides/fetch-network/re-delegating-staked-fet-token#choosing-a-validator) for more details.
</Callout>

3. Connect your wallet, if it is not yet connected, by pressing **Connect Wallet** at the top right.

4. Choose a validator to stake your FETs with and hit **Stake**.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  To see details of any validator, such as their voting power, self-bonded rate, uptime, active/inactive status at any given time, and contact information, head over to [this page ↗️](https://explore.fetch.ai/validators). For a visualization of the validators' voting power (more is NOT better) check out [this page](https://explore.fetch.ai/voting-power-distribution).
</Callout>

5. In the pop-up, select the amount of FETs you want to delegate to this validator and press **Stake**.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Don't forget to leave some FETs undelegated, as some amount is necessary to pay for transaction fees when submitting any transaction to the main network. The fee is very minimal, but it is still important to make sure you have some FETs to pay for it.
</Callout>

6. Your Fetch Wallet shows you a summary of the transaction. Review it, select a transaction fee, and if you are happy, hit **Approve** to complete the operation.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  When you remove your stake, there is an unbonding (also known as, cooldown) period of 21 days. In your staking dashboard, the **Unbonding Delegations** section shows you the stakes you have removed which are now in the unbonding period. You can also see the amount of FET unbonded and the number of days remaining from the unbonding period. This is how long you need to wait before being able to withdraw the funds to your wallet.
