# How to stake FET with the Fetch.ai Wallet

Staking is the process of delegating to a validator. Delegators bond their funds to validator nodes and in doing so support the security and longevity of the network.

As a consequence of the provided support for the network delegators receive rewards in the form of FET. Rewards are paid on a per-block basis and added to the existing rewards.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Your funds never leave your wallet throughout the staking duration. You can remove your stake at any time. 
      Once you remove your stake you'll have to wait for 21 days before your FET is available. This is the standard waiting time across Cosmos SDK based blockchain projects and acts as a security measure for the network.

Additional information on different ways to stake FET tokens can be found [here ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/different-ways-to-stake-the-fet-token). Also, checkout the following guides ofr a better understanding of the staking process both on **Fetch Web** and **Mobile** Wallet:

- [Stake on Fetch Web Wallet ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/fetch-wallet/web-wallet/stake)

## Staking 

1. Download and install the Fetch.ai browser extension wallet [Fetch wallet ↗️](https://fetch.ai/get-fetch-wallet)

2. If this is your first time setting up the wallet select the **Create new account** option. If you have an existing account select the **Import existing account** option and restore your wallet by inputting your seed phrase. If you're using a ledger hardware wallet select the **Connect ledger** option. 

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Here, you will find a list of every active [validator ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/validators) with whom you can stake your FETs. You can also see the amount of FET staked to each validator and their commission rates.

      The validators on this page are ordered according to the number of FETs delegated to them and not their reputation or benefits. Visit the [Choosing a validator ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/re-delegating-staked-fet-token#choosing-a-validator) section for further details on key points to be considered when choosing a validator.

3. Log into the wallet and select **Stake** . This will open up the staking interface. Here you can browse all validators and select one or multiple validators to stake with. 

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      You can check the details of any validator, including their _voting power_, _self-bonded rate_, _uptime_, _active/inactive status_ at any given time, as well as _contact information_, by heading over to [this page ↗️](https://explore.fetch.ai/validators). For a visualization of the validators' _voting power_ (more is NOT better) check out [this page](https://explore.fetch.ai/voting-power-distribution).

4. Choose the FET amount you wish to stake and select the validator of your choice.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Don't forget to leave atleast 1 available undelegated FET in your wallet. This minimum amount is necessary to pay for transaction fees, claim staking rewards, redelegate and remove your stake. The transaction fee is minimal but it is not zero. This is why it's important to have atleast 1 available FET.

      When you remove your stake, there is an unbonding (also known as, cooldown) period of 21 days. In your staking dashboard, the **Unbonding Delegations** section shows you the stakes you have removed which are now in the unbonding period. You can also see the amount of FET unbonded and the number of days remaining from the unbonding period. This is how long you need to wait before being able to withdraw the funds to your wallet.
