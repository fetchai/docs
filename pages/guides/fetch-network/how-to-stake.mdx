# How to stake FET with the Fetch.ai Wallet

Staking is the process of delegating to a validator. Delegators bond their funds to validtor nodes and in doing so support the security and longevity of the network. 

As a consequence of the provided support for the network delegators receive rewards in the form of FET. Rewards are paid on a per-block basis and added to the existing rewards.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Your funds never leave your wallet throughout the staking duration. You can remove your stake at any time. 
      Once you remove your stake you'll have to wait for 21 days before your FET is available. This is the standard waiting time across Cosmos SDK based blockchain projects and acts as a security measure for the network.

Additional information on different ways to stake FET tokens can be found [here ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/different-ways-to-stake-the-fet-token).

## Staking 

1. Download and install the Fetch.ai browser extension wallet [Fetch wallet ↗️](https://fetch.ai/get-fetch-wallet)

2. If this is your first time setting up the wallet select the **Create new account** option. If you have an existing account select the **Import existing account** option and restore your wallet by inputting your seed phrase. If you're using a ledger hardware wallet select the **Connect ledger** option. 


    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Always ensure to keep your seed phrase securely stored and private. No one from the Fetch.ai team will ever ask for your seed phrase. Never share your seed phrase with anyone that you don't explicitly know and trust.

3. Log into the wallet and select **Stake** . This will open up the staking interface. Here you can browse all validators and select one or multiple validators to stake with. 

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      The validators on this page are ordered according to their voting power which is measured in the amount of FET delegated to them and not their reputation or benefits. See [choosing a validator](/guides/fetch-network/re-delegating-staked-fet-token#choosing-a-validator) for more details.
      To see details of any validator, such as their voting power, self-bonded rate, uptime, active/inactive status at any given time, and contact information, head over to [this page ↗️](https://www.mintscan.io/fetchai/validators). For a visualization of the validators' voting power (more is NOT better) check out [this page](https://explore.fetch.ai/voting-power-distribution).

4. Choose the FET amount you wish to stake and select the validator of your choice. 
    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Don't forget to leave atleast 1 available undelegated FET in your wallet. This minimum amount is necessary to pay for transaction fees, claim staking rewards, redelegate and remove your stake. The transaction fee is minimal but it is not zero. This is why it's important to have atleast 1 available FET.
