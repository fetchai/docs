# How to add contract templates

## Introduction

Once we have successfully [created your project ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/jenesis/getting-started#create-a-new-project), you can add **contract templates**.

A contract template is a pre-defined, reusable blueprint or pattern for creating a smart contract in a blockchain environment. It provides a structured starting point with predefined functionalities, variables, and logic that can be customized to suit specific use cases.

 A contract template is a specific implementation that can be added to a project. These templates serve as a foundation for creating contracts by providing pre-configured settings, initial code, and common functionalities. They streamline the process of developing contracts by offering a structured starting point that developers can build upon. By using contract templates, developers can save time and effort in setting up the basic structure and functionalities of their contracts, allowing them to focus on customizing and implementing the specific features required for their use case.

## Overview

To add a template, we first need to navigate into your project's directory and run the following command:

    ```
    jenesis add contract <template> <contract_name>
    ```

We can find all the contract templates available in [Jenesis Templates ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/jenesis-templates) GitHub repository. As for an overview, the available templates are the following:

    - **starter**: a bare-bones contract that sets and increments a counter, [here ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/jenesis-templates/tree/master/contracts/starter).

    - **token**: a fungible token contract, [here ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/jenesis-templates/tree/master/contracts/cw20-base).

    - **proxy**: a basic proxy contract, [here ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/jenesis-templates/tree/master/contracts/cw1-subkeys)

    - **multisig**: a fixed multisig contract, [here ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/jenesis-templates/tree/master/contracts/cw3-fixed-multisig).

    - **nft**: a general token contract supporting nfts, [here ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/jenesis-templates/tree/master/contracts/cw721-base).

    - **oracle**: a contract storing a value to be requested for a fee, [here ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/jenesis-templates/tree/master/contracts/oracle).

    - **oracle-client**: a contract for requesting a value for a fee from a specified oracle contract, [here ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/jenesis-templates/tree/master/contracts/oracle_client).

### Example: CW-20 basic template for fungible token contract

The **cw20-base** template is designed for creating CW-20 tokens on the Fetch.ai blockchain. CW-20 tokens are a standard interface for fungible tokens. This template provides a solid starting point for developers looking to create their own custom CW-20 tokens, complete with essential functionalities like transfers, approvals, and querying balances.

The steps needed to add the **cw20-base** template with the name `my_token` is provided below:

    ```
    jenesis add contract cw20-base my_token
    ```

If we need multiple deployments of the same contract, we can use the `--deployments` or `-d` flag to specify multiple deployments and name them:

    ```
    jenesis add contract <template> <contract_name> [--deployments <deployments>]
    ```

Jenesis will add the deployments to all profiles for the specified contract.

In the example below, `token_1` and `token_2` deployments have been added. This will allow us to deploy `my_token` contract with two different configurations. We can add as many deployments as we wish:

    ```
    jenesis add contract cw20-base my_token -d token_1 token_2
    ```

If no deployments are selected when adding a contract, the default deployment name will be equal to the contract name.

This `add contract` command will add a contract template to our jenesis project inside `contracts/my_token/` folder. It will also update the `jenesis.toml` configuration file with the contract information:

    ```toml
    [profile.testing.contracts.token_1]
    name = "token_1"
    contract = "my_token"
    network = "fetchai-testnet"
    deployer_key = ""
    init_funds = ""

    [profile.testing.contracts.token_2]
    name = "token_2"
    contract = "my_token"
    network = "fetchai-testnet"
    deployer_key = ""
    init_funds = ""

    [profile.testing.contracts.token_1.init]

    [profile.testing.contracts.token_2.init]
    ```

The `deployer_key` field can be manually specified. We can choose any private key locally available to deploy any specific contract. We can also leave this field empty since the `deploy` command has an optional argument to deploy all contracts inside a specified profile with the same key, overriding this `deployer_key` argument in the `jenesis.toml` file. See [deploy contracts ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/jenesis/contracts/deploy-contracts) for more information.

Finally, the `init` section contains the parameters needed in the instantiation message for this contract to be deployed. The required parameters are taken from the schema file inside the `contracts` directory. Since this contract template doesn't include a schema, it will be generated when [compiling ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/jenesis/contracts/compile-contracts) the `my_token` contract loading the init fields to the `jenesis.toml` file. You will need to manually add the values for these parameters in their correct variable type, which are listed on the schema file. For this  **my_token** contract, we need to fill the following init fields for each deployment after [compiling ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/jenesis/contracts/compile-contracts).

Below, we can find an example of this:

    ```
    [profile.testing.contracts.token_1.init]
    decimals = 6
    name = "my_token_name"
    symbol = "SYMBOL"
    initial_balances = [{ address = "fetch1d25ap9danl4726uk2nt307y630v87h3h2vq6pl", amount =  "5000"}]

    [profile.testing.contracts.token_2.init]
    decimals = 6
    name = "my_token_name_2"
    symbol = "SYMBOL"
    initial_balances = [{ address = "fetch1d25ap9danl4726uk2nt307y630v87h3h2vq6pl", amount =  "2000"}]
    ```

If our contract requires nested instantiation messages, we may add fields following this structure:

    ```
    [profile.testing.contracts.example-nested-contract.init]
    price = {amount = 1000, denom = DLS}
    info = {performance = {max_speed = 200, unit = kph}, fuel = {consumption = 7, unit = kmpl}}
    ```

    > *NOTE: before editing the `jenesis.toml` configuration file with the desired `deployer_key` and `init` parameters, make sure to first [compile ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/jenesis/contracts/compile-contracts) your contract. All configuration parameters will restart every time a contract is compiled if the schema has changed.*

We can also add contracts manually by copying and pasting the contract directory from another project we may have. However, they would need to follow the same directory structure as the [starter ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/jenesis-templates/tree/master/contracts/starter) template.

When adding a contract manually, we need to update the `jenesis.toml` file with the contract information by running:

    ```
    jenesis update
    ```

The `update` command will automatically detect which contract is missing in the `jenesis.toml` configuration file by revising the contracts directory.

#### Add contract deployments

We can also add further deployments for a given contract by specifying the contract name and the deployment name.

If we want to add a third token called `token_3` using `my_token` contract, we can run:

    ```
    jenesis add deployment my_token token_3
    ```

This will automatically create another deployment entry called `token_3`.

#### Attach deployed contracts

If we add a contract into the project's contract folder that has already been deployed in the network, we can attach the deployment to your project for future interaction using the `attach` command.

To add a deployment to your project, run:

    ```
    jenesis add contract cw20-base my_token -d token_1
    ```

Then compile the contract:

    ```
    jenesis compile
    ```

To attach the contract, we will need to specify the deployment's name and address. We can optionally specify the profile where you wish to insert the contract into. If this is not specified, the deployment will be attached to the default profile, which is the first profile created in our project, unless the `default` settings are manually changed:

    ```
    jenesis attach token_1 fetch18xs97q6h9zgh4sz730a42pp0dqa9sh4eef7eutfkv69q3v2y3x8s72pkua
    ```

This will add the relevant deployment information into a `jenesis.lock` file and we will now be able to interact with `token_1` using [contract interactions ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/jenesis/contracts/contracts-interaction).
