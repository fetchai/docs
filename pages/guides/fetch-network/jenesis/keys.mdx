# Keys 🔑

With the `keys` command you can either list all the locally available `keys` or show the address of a specific key.
If you want to list all the `keys` available, run the following command:

    ```
    jenesis keys list
    ```

If you want to look up the address for a specified key you can use the `show` command and pass the `key` name as an argument:

    ```
    jenesis keys show my_key
    ```

If you wish to access other key functionalities, including adding new keys, looking up an address, and recovering keys, you can use the Fetch Ledger [CLI - Managing Keys ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/keys) guide.
