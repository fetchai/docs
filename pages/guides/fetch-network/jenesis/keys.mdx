# Keys

You can use the `keys` command to either list all the locally available `keys` or show the address of a specific key.
You can list all the `keys` available by simply running the following command:

    ```
    jenesis keys list
    ```

On the other hand, you can look up the address for a specified key by running the `show` command and pass the `key` name as an argument:

    ```
    jenesis keys show my_key
    ```

If you wish to access other key functionalities, including _adding new keys_, _looking up an address_, and _recovering keys_, you can use the [Fetchd CLI - Managing Keys ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/keys) guide.
