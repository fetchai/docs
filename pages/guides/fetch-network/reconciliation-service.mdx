# Reconciliation service

The [Reconciliation service ↗️](https://companion.fetch.ai/fetchhub-4/reconciliation) has been built to restore access
of the migrated funds for affected users after the stake migration from Fetch Staking platform on Ethereum mainnet to
the Fetch Mainnet.

In particular, this service is aimed at users, who used Hardware Wallets for staking of their ERC-20 FET tokens on Fetch
Staking platform on Ethereum mainnet.

Due to limitations of Hardware Wallets, these users could not use their Hardware Wallets to access their funds migrated
to Fetch mainnet without compromising the air-gap protection level Hardware Wallets offer.

This new reconciliation service resolves this issue, allowing all affected users with Hardware Wallets to regain access
to their funds.

## Requirements

First, make sure you have installed the [ASI Alliance Wallet ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/asi-wallet/web-wallet/get-started)
browser extension, and it has added an account, where you want the recovered funds to be sent to.\

That account must have some funds on it to pay for transaction fee (`1 FET` should be way more than enough).\
You can buy FET from different centralized or decentralized exchanges.

Secondly, you also need to make sure you have the [Metamask ↗️](https://metamask.io/) wallet browser extension installed,
and it has added the account you originally used to stake your ERC-20 FET tokens on Fetch Staking platform on Ethereum
mainnet.

Once you satisfy these two requirements, head over to the
[Reconciliation page ↗️](https://companion.fetch.ai/fetchhub-4/reconciliation) and follow the instructions step-by-step.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      It is important to remember that your Metamask Wallet **must** be connected to the **Ethereum Mainnet**, and your
      ASI Alliance Wallet **must** be connected to the **Fetch Mainnet (fetchhub-4)**.

## Walk-through

Head over to the [Reconciliation page ↗️](https://companion.fetch.ai/fetchhub-4/reconciliation) and click on **Next**.

### Step 1

You need to connect your ASI Alliance Wallet in order to retrieve the **Recovery Address** where your reconciled funds
will be sent to. Click the **Connect Wallet** button and provide the data needed to log in to your ASI Alliance Wallet.

      ![](src/images/reconciliation/reconciliation_2.png)

A pop-up will show up; click **Approve**.

      ![](src/images/reconciliation/reconciliation_2a.png)

You will then be able to see the **Recovery Address** where your reconciled funds will be sent to.\
You can change the **Recovery Address** at any point via the ASI Alliance Wallet extension, by choosing any other
account of choice.

      ![](src/images/reconciliation/reconciliation_2b.png)

You can then click on **Next**.

### Step 2
Now it is necessary to select the Ethereum address you originally used for staking on Ethereum - the selected address
**MUST** be the one you used to stake your tokens on Fetch Staking platform on **Ethereum** mainnet.

Open your Metamask extension and click on **Connect**

      ![](src/images/reconciliation/reconciliation_3.png)

Once you do so, you will see that the fields in the page will be automatically populated based on account you selected
in the Metamask.

You can switch between any of your Metamask accounts. The fields will be updated automatically based on account chosen
in Metamask.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
        If you select address which was **never** used for staking on Fetch Staking platform on Ethereum mainnet, or if
        that address was already reconciled, then the Reconciliation dApp will display the following error message in
        red color: <span style={{color: '#ff0000'}}>`"This address appears to not be affected by the staking migration
        issue"`</span>, see the screenshot below.

        Then it will be necessary to select **correct** account in the Metamask wallet extension in order to be able to
        continue in the reconciliation workflow.
    </Callout>

      ![](src/images/reconciliation/reconciliation_3d.png)

Once you connected the correct Ethereum account to the Companion App UI, you will be able to see details about the
**Staking Address** and the **Amount to Restore**.

Review the details and press the **Create Signature** button.

That will create Ethereum message associating destination target address on Fetch Mainnet with original Ethereum source
address, and sends it to the **Metamask** wallet for signing.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
       This does **not** require any ETH gas, since all what is being done is generating an Ethereum signature for the
       message.
    </Callout>

      ![](src/images/reconciliation/reconciliation_3e.png)

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Note that amount of tokens displayed in the `Amount to Restore [afet]` box is presented in the `afet` denomination.

      In order to get the amount in `FET` denomination, it is necessary to shift the decimal point by 18 orders of
      magnitude to the left, what means **dividing** the amount displayed by **10<sup>18</sup>**.

      In the example above, the `30000000000000000000` amount displayed there represents `30 [FET]` tokens.
    </Callout>

The Metamask pop-up will appear. Click **Confirm**.

      ![](src/images/reconciliation/reconciliation_3b.png)

Great! Now you will see all the fields fully populated:

      ![](src/images/reconciliation/reconciliation_3c.png)

The resulting signature serves dual purpose:

- Primarily it is the proof of ownership of funds associated with original Ethereum address;
- Secondarily it is proof of association between the Fetch destination recovery address and Ethereum source address.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    **If** user needs to **switch** to a different Ethereum Staking address, then after selecting a new account in the Metamask
    wallet extension, it might be necessary to **connect** the newly selected account in Metamask in order to make the
    Reconciliation dApp UI aware of the account change - see the screenshot below.\
    This will be necessary if the newly selected account was not connected to reconciliation url before.

    User can switch the Ethereum staking address (or Fetch recovery address) at any point during the workflow before
    submitting the transaction.

    ![](src/images/reconciliation/reconciliation_3f.png)
</Callout>

Click **Next**.

### Step 3

You will be redirected towards a summary page where you can view all details about the transaction. You can change any of the details you see, but you will be prompted back at the previous steps to reconnect your wallet/accounts. Make sure all details are correct and click **Submit**.

      ![](src/images/reconciliation/reconciliation_4.png)

A pop-up will appear for your ASI Alliance Wallet extension. Click **Approve Transaction**.

      ![](src/images/reconciliation/reconciliation_4a.png)

Great! You successfully completed all the steps required. You now should be able to see your reconciled funds at the
Recovery Address provided similarly to what depicted below:
