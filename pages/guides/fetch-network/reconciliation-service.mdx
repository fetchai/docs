# Reconciliation service

During the stake migration from ETH to the Fetch Mainnet on September 14th, 2021, the staked funds were all migrated from the Ethereum staking contract to the Fetch.ai Mainnet. In this process, some users decided to wait for reconciliation to access their funds after the auto-migration was complete.

The [Reconciliation service ↗️](https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/reconciliation) has been built to restore access of the migrated funds for these users.

      Importantly, the reconciliation service is specifically for those users who opted to not use the guides to gain access to their staked funds during the stake migration. If you are unable to access your funds for any other reason, for example you were hacked, then the reconciliation service is not applicable to you!**

## Instructions

First, make sure the following conditions are satisfied:

    1. Your [Fetch wallet ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/fetch-wallet/web-wallet/get-started) is set up and you have access to it. The address of the account on your Fetch wallet must have recorded at least one transaction on the network. **If you have never made a transaction using this address before, the reconciliation tool and the network have no way of knowing your wallet exists and will not allow you to complete the final submission**.

    2. You have **at least 1 Native FET token** in your wallet to pay the transaction fee associated with the reconciliation tool. You can buy FET from different centralized or decentralized exchanges.

    3. You have the [Metamask wallet ↗️](https://metamask.io/)set up and configured with the address you used in the original staking platform.

If the above conditions are satisfied, head over to the [reconciliation service ↗️](https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/reconciliation) and follow the instructions.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      The reconciliation service is activated at certain times so users can register with it. For economic safety, the fund transfers only happen during network upgrades.

Once your registered transaction is successful and your reconciliation request is deemed valid, the funds will be automatically released to the mainnet address on your Fetch wallet.
