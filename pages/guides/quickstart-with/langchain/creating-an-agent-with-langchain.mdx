# Getting started with Fetch.ai x Langchain

Fetch.ai creates a dynamic communication layer that allows you to abstract away components into individual [Agents ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/getting-started/whats-an-agent). Agents are micro-services that are programmed to communicate with other agents, and or humans. By using **Agents** to represent different parts of your **Langchain** program you give your project the option to be used by [other parties ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/intermediate/communicating-with-other-agents) for economic benefit.

Let's take a look at a simple Langchain example, then see how we can extend this with agents.

## A simple langchain example

Let's create a simple script that can find any information in a PDF. Using a document loader from Langchain, and FAISS vector store along with OpenAI, we can load the PDF, use `FAISS` to create a vector store, `open_ai` to create embeddings on the documents, and then use `FAISS` to do a similarity search. Quite complicated for a small example, but it is only a handful of lines of code:

```python copy
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
import os
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

openai_api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']

loader = PyPDFLoader("./your-pdf.pdf")
pages = loader.load_and_split()

faiss_index = FAISS.from_documents(pages, OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=openai_api_key))

docs = faiss_index.similarity_search("what problem does fetch solve?", k=2)
for doc in docs:
    print(str(doc.metadata["page"]) + ":", doc.page_content[:600])

```

However, there is a lot of smaller bits happening there. If we use agents for each step, then other agents can use those pieces of code üí°.

## A simple communication with agents

Fetch.ai has the concept of an agent which at a base level an agent cannot do what Langchain does, however an agent is the component that links them together.

You can read more about agents communication in our [guides ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/intermediate/communicating-with-other-agents)

Let's install what we need:

```bash copy
poetry init
poetry add uagents
```

Check out more detailed instructions for [installation ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/getting-started/installing-uagent) of `uagents` library on your end.

### First Agent

Our first agent is simple; it sends a message every two seconds to a static address. When this agent receives a message, it prints that to log:

```python copy filename="first_agent.py"
from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

class Message(Model):
    message: str

RECIPIENT_ADDRESS = "agent1qf4au6rzaauxhy2jze6v85rspgvredx9m42p0e0cukz0hv4dh2sqjuhujpp"

agent = Agent(
    name="agent",
    port=8000,
    seed="",
    endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
)

fund_agent_if_low(agent.wallet.address())

@agent.on_interval(period=2.0)
async def send_message(ctx: Context):
    await ctx.send(RECIPIENT_ADDRESS, Message(message="hello there"))

@agent.on_message(model=Message)
async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent.run()

```

This first agent introduces a few core concepts you will need to be aware of when creating any agent.

Agents are defined with the `Agent` class:

```python copy
    agent = Agent(
    name="agent",
    port=8000,
    seed="",
    endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
)
```

A `seed` is a unique phrase which `uagents` library uses to create a unique private key pair for your agent. If you change your `seed` you may lose access to previous messages, and also, the agent's address registered to the Almanac will change subsequently. The `port` allows us to define a local port for messages to be received. The `endpoint` defines the path to the in-built Rest API. The `name` defines the name of the agent.

There are more options for the `Agent` class; see [`Agent` Class ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/uagents/uagents-api/agent) for further reference.

We then need to define our communication model:

```python copy
    class Message(Model):
        message: str
```

The `Model` defines the object sent from agent to agent and represents the type of messages the agent is able to handle. For explicit communication, both agents must handle the same `Model` class.  `Model` is the base class that inherits from Pydantic BaseModel.

With the `fund_agent_if_low(agent.wallet.address())` function, agents will ultimately pay for discoverability as the economy of agents matures. There is a placeholder for registration here.

Finally, agents have two decorated functions. 

The first one is the `agent.on_interval()` function. This one sends a message every 2 seconds. `ctx.send()` has the args of `destination_address` and `Message` which we defined earlier.

```python copy
@agent.on_interval(period=2.0)
async def send_message(ctx: Context):
    await ctx.send(RECIPIENT_ADDRESS, Message(message="hello there"))
```

The second one is `agent.on_message()` which is a little different; when the agent receives a message at the `endpoint` we defined earlier, the `uagent` library unpacks the message and triggers any function which handles that message; in our case, the `agent.on_message()` function:

```python copy
@agent.on_message(model=Message)
async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")
```

### Second Agent

Agent two doesn't do anything different to agent one; it has different args for the Agent instantiation, and instead of sending a message `on_event("startup")`, agent two just logs its address to screen. Whenever agent two receives a message matching `Message` data model, it will send a response to the sender.

```python copy filename="second_agent.py"
from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low
from uagents import Agent, Context, Model


class Message(Model):
    message: str

agent = Agent(
    name="agent 2",
    port=8001,
    seed="",
    endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit"],
)

fund_agent_if_low(agent.wallet.address())

@agent.on_event("startup")
async def start(ctx: Context):
    ctx.logger.info(f"agent address is {agent.address}")

@agent.on_message(model=Message)
async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

    await ctx.send(sender, Message(message="hello there"))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent.run()

```

Okay, let's now run these agents.

### Running the agents

Let's run the second agent's script first using this command: `poetry run python second_agent.py`

**We must run the second agent first to get its unique address**. This is shown in output in the log. Let's update `first_agent.py` script by filling the `RECIPIENT_ADDRESS` field with the address of the second agent from of the output we previously got by running `second_agent.py` script.

Updated `first_agent.py` script sample:

```python copy filename="agent_one.py"
from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low
 
class Message(Model):
    message: bool
 
RECIPIENT_ADDRESS="agent...."
 
agent = Agent(
    	...
```

Then, let's run the script for the first agent using this command: `poetry run python first_agent.py`

Great! You should now be seeing some log out output with our messages being displayed.

### Output

- **First Agent**:

    ```

    INFO:     [agent 2]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```

## Wrapping them together - Building a service

Let's go further now and change our agents scripts by splitting the logic of the Langchain example above. Let's have one agent that sends a PDF path and questions it wants answered about that PDF by the other agent. Conversely, the other agent returns information on the PDF based on the questions asked by using Langchain tools.

### Agent one: providing PDF and requesting information

This agent sends `DocumentUnderstanding` model which contains a local path to a PDF, and a question that the other agent must answer about the PDF. It's a small update on our first agent script.

However now, `.on_message(model=DocumentsResponse)` expects a `DocumentsResponse` object instead of a string.

To learn more about communication with other agents check out the following [Guide ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/intermediate/communicating-with-other-agents)

```python copy filename="langchain_agent_one.py"
from uagents import Agent, Context, Protocol, Model
from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType
from typing import List

class DocumentUnderstanding(Model):
    pdf_path: str
    question: str

class DocumentsResponse(Model):
    learnings: List

agent = Agent(
    name="find_in_pdf",
    seed="",
    port=8001,
    endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit"]
)

print("uAgent address: ", agent.address)
summary_protocol = Protocol("Text Summarizer")

RECIPIENT_PDF_AGENT = ""

@agent.on_event("startup")
async def on_startup(ctx: Context):
    await ctx.send(RECIPIENT_PDF_AGENT, DocumentUnderstanding(pdf_path="../a-little-story.pdf", question="What's the synopsis?"))

@agent.on_message(model=DocumentsResponse)
async def document_load(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: DocumentsResponse):
    ctx.logger.info(msg.learnings)

agent.include(summary_protocol, publish_manifest=True)
agent.run()

```

### Agent two: wrapping the Langchain bits

Agent two defines the same models as agent one, but this time, it wraps the logic for the Langchain PDF question in the `document_load()` function, which is decorated with `.on_message(model=DocumentUnderstanding, replies=DocumentsResponse)` . You can specify a `replies` argument in your `on_message` decorators; this is useful for being more explicit with communication.

```python copy filename="langchain_agent_two.py"
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
import os
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from uagents import Agent, Context, Protocol, Model
from typing import List

class DocumentUnderstanding(Model):
    pdf_path: str
    question: str

class DocumentsResponse(Model):
    learnings: List

pdf_questioning_agent = Agent(
    name="pdf_questioning_agent",
    seed="",
    port=8003,
    endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8003/submit"],
)

print("uAgent address: ", pdf_questioning_agent.address)
pdf_loader_protocol = Protocol("Text Summariser")

@pdf_questioning_agent.on_message(model=DocumentUnderstanding, replies=DocumentsResponse)
async def document_load(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: DocumentUnderstanding):
    loader = PyPDFLoader(msg.pdf_path)
    pages = loader.load_and_split()
    openai_api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']
    learnings = []

    faiss_index = FAISS.from_documents(pages, OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=openai_api_key))

    docs = faiss_index.similarity_search(msg.question, k=2)

    for doc in docs:
        learnings.append(str(doc.metadata["page"]) + ":" + doc.page_content[:600])

    await ctx.send(sender, DocumentsResponse(learnings=learnings))

pdf_questioning_agent.include(pdf_loader_protocol, publish_manifest=True)
pdf_questioning_agent.run()

```

With these agents now being defined, it is time to run them. Let's run Agent two first to get its address and then update Agent one to send a message to it by filling the `RECIPIENT_PDF_AGENT` field in-line.

### Expected Output

Run `poetry run python langchain_agent_two.py` first and then `poetry run python langchain_agent_one.py`. 

You should get something similar to the following for each agent:

- **Langchain Agent 1**:

    ```
    uAgent address agent:  agent1qv9qmj3ug83vcrg774g2quz0urmlyqlmzh6a5t3r88q3neejlrffz405p7x

    INFO:     [find_in_pdf]: ['0: This is a simple story about two ... ]
    ```

- **Langchain Agent 2**:

    INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
    ```
## Next steps

In the [next part ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/quickstart-with/langchain/multiple-agent-workflows) of this introduction, we will create a multi-agent workflow where we split the logic of the PDF agent into two more agents: the first one which verifies a PDF, loads and then splits the PDF and the second one which uses FAISS to do the similarity search.
