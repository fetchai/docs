# Getting started with Fetch.ai x CrewAI

Fetch.ai provides a dynamic communication layer that allows you to modularize components into distinct [Agents ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/whats-an-agent)️. In this ecosystem, Agents act as microservices, programmed to communicate either with other agents or with humans. While other frameworks also create agents, here we’ll explore how Fetch.ai’s unique agent architecture can complement and extend CrewAI’s functionality.

By using Fetch.ai’s Agents to represent various elements of your Crew, your project can be designed to interact with [third parties ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/communicating-with-other-agents)️ to enhance both flexibility and scalability and increase potential economic benefits.

In this guide, we'll walk you through a simple CrewAI example to understand its fundamentals and then demonstrate how we can enhance this model by integrating Fetch.ai Agents for advanced communication and workflow management.

## A simple CrewAI example

Let's use a shortened example that CrewAI provides; in this example we define an Agent and a Task. At a high level here, Agent is defining the LLMs "personality" and the Task is what that LLM is to solve.

This is a nice feature; we love the idea of having many tasks and then orchestrating to agents which can execute them.
But what if we want to create a workflow, perhaps one where information is passed back and forwards?

Next, let us show you two Agents, which communicate, just like that.

## A simple communication with agents

Fetch.ai has the concept of an agent where this is an agent that is the component that links agents together. 

You can read more about agents communication in our [guides ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/communicating-with-other-agents)

Let's install what we need:

    ```bash copy
    poetry init
    poetry add uagents
    ```

Check out more detailed instructions for [installation ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/installing-uagent) of `uagents` library on your end.

### First Agent

Our first agent is simple; it sends a message every two seconds to a static address. When this agent receives a message, it prints that to log:

	RECIPIENT_ADDRESS = "agent1qf4au6rzaauxhy2jze6v85rspgvredx9m42p0e0cukz0hv4dh2sqjuhujpp"
	
	agent = Agent(
	    name="agent",
	    port=8000,
	    seed="",
	    endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
	)

	if __name__ == "__main__":
	    agent.run()

```
</DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>



This first agent introduces a few core concepts you will need to be aware of when creating any agent.

Agents are defined with the `Agent` class:

<GithubCodeSegment digest="672e73a8e18ce446b18bc6b532362a32">
    <CodeSegment
        path="https://github.com/fetchai/uAgent-Examples/blob/main/5-documentation/guides/quickstart-with/CrewAI/creating-an-agent-with-crewai/sender_agent.py"
        lineStart={11}
        lineEnd={16}

    />
</GithubCodeSegment>
<CodeGroup dynamic hasCopy isLocalHostedFile digest='672e73a8e18ce446b18bc6b532362a32'>

<DocsCode local={true}>
	```py copy filename="sender_agent.py"

	agent = Agent(
	    name="agent",
	    port=8000,
	    seed="",
	    endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit"],
	)

```
</DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>



A `seed` is a unique phrase which `uagents` library uses to create a unique private key pair for your agent. If you change your `seed` you may lose access to previous messages, and also, the agent's address registered to the Almanac will change subsequently. The `port` allows us to define a local port for messages to be received. The `endpoint` defines the path to the in-built Rest API. The `name` defines the name of the agent.

There are more options for the `Agent` class; see [`Agent` Class ↗️](/references/uagents/api/agent) for further reference.

We then need to define our **communication model**:

<GithubCodeSegment digest="a46c48221f19f43d31de9fa57ada1887">
    <CodeSegment
        path="https://github.com/fetchai/uAgent-Examples/blob/main/5-documentation/guides/quickstart-with/CrewAI/creating-an-agent-with-crewai/sender_agent.py"
        lineStart={5}
        lineEnd={6}
        hosted={true}
    />
</GithubCodeSegment>
<CodeGroup dynamic hasCopy isLocalHostedFile digest='a46c48221f19f43d31de9fa57ada1887'>

<DocsCode local={true}>
	```py copy filename="sender_agent.py"

	class Message(Model):
	    message: str

```
</DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>



The `Model` defines the object sent from agent to agent and represents the type of messages the agent is able to handle. For explicit communication, both agents must handle the same `Model` class. `Model` is the base class that inherits from Pydantic BaseModel.

With the `fund_agent_if_low(agent.wallet.address())` function, agents will ultimately pay for discoverability as the economy of agents matures. There is a placeholder for registration here.

Finally, agents have two decorated functions. 

The first one is the `agent.on_interval()` function. This one sends a message every 2 seconds. `ctx.send()` has the args of `destination_address` and `Message` which we defined earlier.

<GithubCodeSegment digest="048b49e23e4dbc8139f4d9573c8ef1eb">
    <CodeSegment
        path="https://github.com/fetchai/uAgent-Examples/blob/main/5-documentation/guides/quickstart-with/CrewAI/creating-an-agent-with-crewai/sender_agent.py"
        lineStart={21}
        lineEnd={23}

    />
</GithubCodeSegment>
<CodeGroup dynamic hasCopy isLocalHostedFile digest='048b49e23e4dbc8139f4d9573c8ef1eb'>

	```py copy filename="sender_agent.py"

	@agent.on_interval(period=2.0)
	async def send_message(ctx: Context):
	    await ctx.send(RECIPIENT_ADDRESS, Message(message="hello there"))

```
</DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>



The second one is `agent.on_message()` which is a little different; when the agent receives a message at the `endpoint` we defined earlier, the `uagent` library unpacks the message and triggers any function which handles that message; in our case, the `agent.on_message()` function:

<GithubCodeSegment digest="80e840ac9860d0707fc97dfdcb155861">
    <CodeSegment
        path="https://github.com/fetchai/uAgent-Examples/blob/main/5-documentation/guides/quickstart-with/CrewAI/creating-an-agent-with-crewai/sender_agent.py"

	async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
	    ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

```
</DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>



### Second Agent

Agent two doesn't do anything different to agent one; it has different args for the Agent instantiation, and instead of sending a message `on_event("startup")`, agent two just logs its address to screen. Whenever agent two receives a message matching `Message` data model, it will send a response to the sender.

	from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low
	from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
	
	
	class Message(Model):
	    message: str
	
	
	agent = Agent(
	    name="agent 2",
	    port=8001,
	    seed="",
	    endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit"],
	)
	
	fund_agent_if_low(agent.wallet.address())
	
	
	@agent.on_event("startup")
	async def start(ctx: Context):
	    ctx.logger.info(f"agent address is {agent.address}")
	
	
	@agent.on_message(model=Message)
	async def message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
	    ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")
	
	    await ctx.send(sender, Message(message="hello there"))
	
	
	if __name__ == "__main__":
	    agent.run()

```
</DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>



Okay, let's now run these agents.

### Running the agents

Let's run the second agent's script first using this command: `poetry run python receiver_agent.py`

**We must run the second agent first to get its unique address**. This is shown in output in the log. Let's update `sender_agent.py` script by filling the `RECIPIENT_ADDRESS` field with the address of the second agent from of the output we previously got by running `receiver_agent.py` script.

Updated `sender_agent.py` script sample:

    ```python copy filename="agent1.py"
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
    from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

    class Message(Model):
        message: bool

    RECIPIENT_ADDRESS="agent...."

    agent = Agent(
            ...
    ```

Then, let's run the script for the first agent using this command: `poetry run python sender_agent.py`

Great! You should now be seeing some log out output with our messages being displayed.

### Output

# happy to here

## Wrapping them together - Building a service

Let's go further now and change our agents scripts by splitting the logic of the CrewAI example above. Let's have one agent that creates a task and another agent which fulfills it.  

### Agent one: Senior Research Analyst Agent

The `senior_research_analyst_agent`, is designed to handle requests for city-specific information by researching advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and providing current weather updates. It utilizes the `SerperDevTool` for web searches and employs models for managing input and output.

- `create_task(city: str) -> Task`: This method formulates a task description that outlines the specific research and weather update needed for the given city, returning a Task object.

- `run_process(city: str)`: This method coordinates the execution of the created task. It initializes a Crew process that includes the research agent and the task, allowing it to gather results efficiently.

- `handle_city_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: CityRequestModel)`: This function listens for incoming messages containing city names. Upon receiving a request, it logs the city name, initiates the research process, and sends back a report that includes both AI advancements and weather data.

When a request is received with a city name, the agent logs the request, conducts a comprehensive analysis, and returns a report that combines AI insights with real-time weather data. This functionality makes it a valuable tool for research organizations and tech consultancies seeking relevant information.

### Agent two: Research Asking Agent

The `research_asking_agent` agent is designed to initiate requests for city-specific research information and manage responses related to research reports.

- Models: `CityRequestModel` for storing the city name and `ResearchReportModel` for the research findings.

- Startup Event: The `on_startup` function logs the agent's name and address, then sends a message to a target agent with the default city (London).

- Message Handling: The `handle_research_report` function processes incoming reports, logging the sender's address and the content of the research report.

This agent operates continuously, enabling effective communication and retrieval of city-related research insights.
