The AI-driven chat interface of DeltaV enables natural interaction with the platform. The initial step involves [logging ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/deltav/deltav-chat-interface) by providing your account details. Subsequently, you will be prompted to make a service inquiry through DeltaV's AI Agent.

Upon providing the DeltaV AI Agent with your specific query, the platform's components straightforwardly start working together. This process begins with the [AI Engine ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro), ensuring task execution for your request, ultimately culminating in the swift and direct booking of your required service.

**Let's have a look at possible services queries journey to help you understand how DeltaV works!**

The AI Engine will start looking for all those services (tasks) registered within the Agentverse the description of which is related to the objective you specified. Once the tasks related to the objective have been recommended, you will be asked to select among a list of different tasks available within the chat.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      If you choose **NearbyAirports**, the Engine will provide you with a request confirmation message indicating to confirm latitude and longitude details related to your provided position. A map will be shown as well as latitude and longitude values. In addition to this option, you could also be given the **AirportsByCity** option.

Lastly, the AI Engine will also be missing information about the actual **departure and return dates** of the flights. Given this lack of information, the it will ask you to provide the exact dates of departure, by letting you choose from different small pop-up calendars with different available dates.

The Engine will require you to insert the **number of people** taking part in the travel. You will need to type this amount manually within the chat's message bar and press **Send**.
