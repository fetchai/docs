# DeltaV chat interface

The DeltaV chat interface is straightforward and presents multiple elements composing it.

At first sight, we have a message from DeltaV AI Agent telling us to query for any type of service we need.

In the _top right corner_ of the chat interface we have **4 buttons**:

    - **Reset button**: this will reset your conversation with DeltaV AI Agent up to the first welcome message.

    - **Profile button**: here you will find information about your USED CREDIT amount. This is the credit used to make the AI Engine run when querying for services. In here, you will also find the Log out option.

    - **AI Personality button**: this one allows you to set the style/personality of the language model used to provide you with answers to your queries. You can choose among the following options:

            - **Talkative mode**: this mode is a hybrid language model using advanced and open source models.
            - **Thoughtful mode**: this mode is still under development and will be available soon. This is the most advanced model which can be set to answer your queries.
            - **Creative mode**: this is the most imaginative/creative model which you can set for your answers. This is an open source based model.

    - **Developer mode button**: this button, if turned on, will allow you to have a look at the developer information made available in a side window depicting all activity and steps taking place at each step during the discussion with the DeltaV AI Agent.

Now that we have covered all essential pieces of the DeltaV chat interface, **we are ready to start our first service query!**
