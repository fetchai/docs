# DeltaV chat interface

The DeltaV chat interface is straightforward and presents multiple elements composing it.

At first sight, we have a message from DeltaV AI Agent telling us to query for any type of service we need.

In the _top right corner_ of the chat interface we have **4 buttons**:

    - **Reset button**: this will reset your conversation with DeltaV AI Agent up to the first welcome message.

    - **Profile button**: here you will find information about your USED CREDIT amount. This is the amount of credit you spent interacting via AI Engine and LLMs. The cost depends on the AI personality used. If you run out of credit you can request more. In here, you will also find the Log out option.

    - **AI Personality button**: this one allows you to set the style/personality of the language model used to provide you with answers to your queries. You can choose among the following options:

            - **Talkative mode**: this is our base system and is a hybrid language model using advanced and open source models.
            - **Thoughtful mode**: this is the most powerful model which can be set to answer your queries, but it is still under development and will be available soon. It does the best job.
            - **Creative mode**: this mode uses our own LLM which we are training (i.e. finetuning) given that it is based on open source LLMs.

    - **Developer mode button**: this button, if turned on, will allow you to have a look at the developer information made available in a side window depicting all activity and steps taking place at each step during the discussion with the DeltaV AI Agent. It is a useful resource for developers as you can peek into what is happening internally in the system. It shows information based on what thoughts the AI Engine is making when taking decision. Also shows more detailed error messages.

Now that we have covered all essential pieces of the DeltaV chat interface, **we are ready to start our first service query!**
