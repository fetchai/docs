**But how can you book such a flight using this revolutionary platform?**

First of all, once you have signed in by providing your account details, you will be asked to query for any service by DeltaV AI Agent.

Now, type Book a flight to Dubai into the chat's interface. This will start the **AI Engine** which will figure out the task related to your request and objective. This task will be based on such latter information and the Engine will find all available **AI Agents** registered within the **Agentverse** offering services akin to your request. Once the task has been defined, you will be asked you to select among a list of different tasks. You need to choose the task according to the service you requested. In our case, a _Flights_ task. Given such an input, the Engine will start working on such a task and consequently will start looking for agents providing information about nearby airports available based on latitude and longitude parameters according to your current location.

Then, you will be asked to choose among _NearbyAirports_, _AirportsByCity_ or _Reject_ options.

By choosing the _NearbyAirports_ option, the Engine will provide you with a request confirmation message indicating to confirm _latitude_ and _longitude_ details related to your current position. A _map_ will be shown as well as latitude and longitude values. By choosing the _AirportsByCity_ option, you will be given a list of airports listed by city from which you can choose from.

You can either **Reject** or **Confirm**. If you confirm, the AI Engine will build up the context based also on your inputs to define the optimal AI Agent to which request the execution of the task related to closer airports available. Once an agent is recommended by the Engine, it will provide you with a choice among different IATA codes representing airports located close to your confirmed location.

  In case you are traveling from London, you will be given the following codes: LCY (London City Airport), LGW (London Gatwick Airport), LHR (London Heathrow Airport), and STN (London Stansted Airport).

Choose your preferred choice.

At this point, a piece of information missing to the Engine is the _departure date_. Given this lack of information, it will ask you to provide the exact date of departure, by letting you choose from a small pop-up calendar with all dates available. Once you select a date, the Engine will then be missing information about the trip being a _one-way_ or _round trip_ solution. Because of this, it will then ask you to confirm this. In case of a round trip, you will need to provide the return date accordingly.

Then, the Engine will require you to insert the _number of people_ taking part in the travel. You will need to type this amount manually within the chat's messages bar and press **Send**.

Finally, you will be asked to confirm the details related to your Flights, including departure and arrival airports as well as dates of the flights and number of people taking part in the trip. You can either **Confirm** or **Reject**. By confirming, the Engine will build the context according to your responses and will then look for the best agent to execute the task of finding tickets accordingly. Once an agent is recommended and chosen, it will execute the task and send the related answers back to the Engine which will then display them in the chat interface for you to choose the preferred one. At this point, you will be given information about different airlines and flights, with prices and hours of departure and arrival. Once you select the most suitable one according to your needs, a booking confirmation will be sent towards your email gathering all information previously mentioned.

**You can then reset the conversation to request a new service!**
