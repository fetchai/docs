# Utilizing the Agentverse Mailroom feature

## Introduction

The **Agentverse** assists you in setting up mailboxes for local and Agentverse agents, allowing them to have a two-way communication with each other without the need to be constantly online and without requiring your constant presence to operate.

To create a Mailbox, retrieve your local agent address and head over to the **Agentverse: My Agents** tab. Here, click on **Local Agents** and click on **Connect Local Agent**.

You will need to provide the address of the local agent you wish to retrieve and wait for confirmation. You will then need to provide a **name** for the agent.

Once you do so and confirm, you will see a **Mailbox API Key** showing up.

Copy and paste it within your local agent code by filling up the `AGENT_MAILBOX_KEY` field inline. Remember, each agent needs a dedicated separate mailbox!

You can then restart your local agent.

### Local agent setup

Let's now start by creating a local agent named `alice` with a `handle_message()` function using an `@agent.on_message()` decorator to handle messages received by other agents and matching the `Message` class:

<GithubCodeSegment digest="">
    <CodeSegment
        path="https://github.com/fetchai/uAgent-Examples/blob/main/5-documentation/guides/agentverse/agentverse-mailbox/utilising-the-mailbox/local_agent_setup.py"
        lineStart={1}
        lineEnd={32}
        hosted={true}
    />
</GithubCodeSegment>

You can then restart your agent; now your agent doesn't need to run all the time as their messages will be waiting for them for when they come back online.

### Agentverse agent setup

Now create an Agentverse agent `bob` by selecting **+ New Agent** in the **My Agents** tab in the [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/). Then, select a blank script and add the following code into it:

<GithubCodeSegment digest="">
    <CodeSegment
        path="https://github.com/fetchai/uAgent-Examples/blob/main/5-documentation/guides/agentverse/agentverse-mailbox/utilising-the-mailbox/agentverse_agent_setup.py"
        lineStart={1}
        lineEnd={34}
        hosted={true}
    />
</GithubCodeSegment>

Next, run **bob** on the Agentverse.

### Expected output

You will see something like the following depending on the agent considered:

1. Agentverse Agent output:

    ```
    2024-06-27 11:20:19	Info	Agent	[INFO]: Sending message to alice
    2024-06-27 11:20:19	Info	Agent	[INFO]: Received message from agent1qfa53drat8rzau90u4494gx5mhj3v87tm4t5cuzkd7gkegxcm5vx5pku7kf: hello there bob
    ```

2. Local Agent output:

    ```
    INFO:     [ALICE]: Received message from agent1qd3hd6peaejavk3uredlxz05e8tcx6purl5gpuamk22xduj7e37k2sqetaa: hello there alice
    INFO:     [ALICE]: Sending message to bob
    ```
