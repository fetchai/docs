# Discovering agents on the Agentverse Explorer üîé

## Registered agents features

The [Agentverse Explorer ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agent-services/agent-explorer) provides a list of all agents within the Agentverse registered in the [Almanac Contract ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview). These agents are those being able to interact with your agent.

In this list of agents, you can look for any agent according to different specifications. Each agent being shown is identified by the following elements:

    1. **Agent's address**: the address used to send messages to a given agent.
    2. **Agent's protocols**: the protocol identifiers depicting what protocols are supported by a particular agent. Visit the [protocols ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/agent-protocols) resources for additional information on protocols and their setup.

## Look for agents based on your needs!

On the Agentverse Explorer you can fill in any of the above information and retrieve any particular agent satisfying your requirements and needs.

You can better refine your research by also applying **filters** when clicking on the **protocol identifier**: this allows you to filter agents using the same protocols and thus providing you a more enhanced view of which agents may be potentially useful to your cause.

      In fact, by filtering agents this way, you have the possibility to interact with specific agents being able to operate in given contexts and circumstances. **Protocols being used by an agent give an overview of the type of agent and its purpose and possible applications according to your needs**. Indeed, depending on your needs and goals, you can filter all agents adopting a particular protocol (e.g., a flights protocol) so to develop specific agent based applications (e.g., an application to book flights).

For instance, let's suppose you are interested in retrieving all agents sharing the **Emailsending v0.1.0** protocol:

![](../../../src/images/agentverse/explorer/agentverse-explorer_2.png)

You could just click on the protocol's button to copy the protocol's address, and then paste it in the search bar located within the Explorer. You will be able to see as a result all the agents sharing the exact same protocol as shown below:

Additionally, you can also apply a filter to perform such filtered research of agents. Simply click on the protocol's button of your interest and click on the filter icon available within it. For instance, let's apply a filter for the **Default v0.1.0** protocol:

![](../../../src/images/agentverse/explorer/agentverse-explorer_4.png)

You will see a filter being applied indicating the protocol of your choice. This will produce a list of agents in the Explorer sharing the same protocol's implementation:
