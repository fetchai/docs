# Using News API to build network of Primary and Secondary Function in Agentverse

### This is a guide for advanced usage of Agents for DeltaV.

## Introduction

This agents network helps users to read news of different types including **Categorical**, **Country** based or **Keyword** related news. The system operates based on a multiple layers structure of Primary and Secondary Functions, each one of them playing a vital role in delivering personalized news content to users.

There are three layers of Agent Functions to let users read news and which altogether return news matching the specific type and subtype based on the user's preferences. For an overall workflow of the user's requests, please refer below flow chart.

![](../../../src/images/guides/services/utilizing-api-to-build-network-of-task-and-subtask/News_Reading_System_Workflow.drawio.png)

First of all, we have the **News Reading URL System**; this one acts as the gateway to news headlines. This layer enables the  connection between users and the latest news headlines. When the user expresses interest in reading the news, the [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) drives the News Reading System and initiates the process of fetching news articles for the user. Once the system understands your intent is to read news headlines, it will call upon the **News Reading Details Secondary Function**. At this point, users will be required to provide the news type and subtype they want to read via [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav).

Once users provides the input for the type and subtype of news they want to read, the system will take in the user's preferences and decide which specific type of news the user is interested in, whether it it categorical (e.g., business or sports), regional news from a specific country, or news related to a particular keyword.

With the user's news preference in hand, the system redirects request to one of the specialized subtasks: the **Generate news_type Secondary Function**. These secondary functions are like expert news gatherers, each dedicated to a specific type of news based on the user's preference provided.

All **primary** and **secondary** functions redirections are handled by the **AI Engine**. It processes user preferences and triggers the appropriate secondary functions to fulfil the user's objective. By providing clear and concise field descriptions for each primary and secondary functions, the AI Engine will ensure straightforward navigation through the News Reading System and operations, making it easy for users to stay informed on the topics that matter the most to them.

## Primary and Secondary Functions

The **primary** and **secondary** functions descriptions and names should be relevant to make it easy for the LLM to identify the type of function to trigger and when. Descriptions of both functions should always indicate when specific secondary functions should be triggered. In this case, one of multiple secondary functions is to be triggered, it should be provided in the dictionary to enhance the LLM's understanding. For instance, you can refer to the example below where the **News Reading Details Secondary Function** triggers one of the **Generate news_type secondary function** based on the user's requirement.

**Field description** is another feature of functions which should mention use of secondary functions in a clear and concise way. Refer to the [Agentverse Functions ↗️](/guides/services/services) resource for more details on both primary and secondary functions.

## News API

Login to [News API ↗️](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines) and get your API key by logging in and registering for API. This API key will be used in agent scripts to fetch news related to a specific type and subtype.

### News Reading URL System Agent

This agent helps users to read news according to their willingness. This agent triggers the news details gathering secondary function and asks the user for the news type and subtype they want to read today. This agent responds to the final result to the [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav) GUI as well.

    ```python copy filename="agent.py"

    # Here we demonstrate how we can create a news reading system agent that is compatible with DeltaV
        
    # After running this agent, it can be registered to DeltaV on Agentverse My Agents tab. For registration you will have to use the agent's address

    # Import required libraries
    import requests
    from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType

    # Define News Reading Model
    class News(Model):
        news : str

    # Define Protocol for news reading system
    news_protocol = Protocol("News System")

    # Define a handler for the News system protocol
    @news_protocol.on_message(model=News, replies = UAgentResponse)
    async def on_news_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: News):
        #Printing the news response on logger
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received news request from {sender} with title: {msg.news}")
        #Creating hyperlink and sending final response to the DeltaV GUI
        message = f"<a href='{msg.news}'>YOUR NEWS CONTENT</a>"
        await ctx.send(sender, UAgentResponse(message = message, type = UAgentResponseType.FINAL))


    # Include the Generate News protocol in your agent
    agent.include(news_protocol)
    ```

Now click on the **Run** button in the upper right corner of the editor so that you have your news system agent agent up and running!

### News Reading Details Agent

This agent asks users for the type and subtype of news they want to read today from options like **categorical**, **country** related or **keyword** related and respective subtypes. It then directs the user request to relevant subtasks to generate that type of news title and respond it back to the **News Reading system**.

    ```python copy filename="agent.py"
    # Here we demonstrate how we can create a news details agent that is compatible with DeltaV.
    # After running this agent, it can be registered to DeltaV on Agentverse My Agents tab. For registration you will have to use the agent's address.

    # Import required libraries
    import requests
    import json
    from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType

    # Define News Generating Model.

With that, **you have gotten a News Reading URL function which can be discovered and contacted with DeltaV. Awesome!**

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
        If one of multiple secondary functions is to be triggered, it should be mentioned in dictionary rather than writing a description of each as it confuses the DeltaV LLM model. If we mention **"Trigger generate categorical secondary function for user selecting categorical news and trigger generate regional for user selecting regional news and so on...."**, will lead to either non-traceability or wrong selection of secondary functions.
