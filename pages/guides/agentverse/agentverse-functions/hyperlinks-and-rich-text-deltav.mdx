# Rich Text and Hyperlinks in responses in DeltaV

## Introduction

This guide will help you understand how to utilise **rich text** and **hyperlinks** within responses in your [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav) application based on a practical example. This is particularly useful for developers who need to generate interactive and informative content.

## Understanding Rich Text and Hyperlinks

### Rich Text and Hyperlinks

**Rich Text** is a text format that supports a variety of text styles and formatting options beyond plain text. These options include:

    - Bold, Italic, and Underline styles
    - Headings and Subheadings
    - Lists (bullet points and numbered)
    - Hyperlinks

Rich text makes your content more visually appealing and easier to read, improving the user experience.

**Hyperlinks** are clickable texts or elements that redirect users to another resource, such as a web page or document. Hyperlinks are often used to connect related content or provide additional information.

In DeltaV, you can include hyperlinks in your responses, allowing users to easily navigate to relevant resources.

## Why Rich Text and Hyperlinks?

    1. **Enhanced communication**: Rich text allows for better formatting and structure, making your messages clearer and more effective.
    2. **Interactive content**: Hyperlinks enable users to access additional information or related content directly from your responses.
    3. **Improved user experience**: These features make content more engaging and accessible, leading to higher user satisfaction.

## Implementing Rich Text and Hyperlinks in DeltaV responses

In DeltaV, you can integrate rich text and hyperlinks to enhance the responses generated by your agents or automation workflows. Let's look at how you can implement these features. Let's consider a scenario where you want your DeltaV agent to respond with a list of news articles related to a company, with each article presented as a clickable hyperlink.

The script below shows how to integrate external data (e.g., stock symbols or news articles) into a DeltaV agent's response, and how to format that response using rich text, specifically by creating hyperlinks. This approach enhances the communication capabilities of the DeltaV agent, making its responses more dynamic, interactive, and useful for the end-user.

Here's the example of how to do this in:

    ```python copy filename="example.py"
    import requests
    from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType

    # Define a news content structure using the Model class to represent a news content
    class NewsRequest(Model):
        company_name: str

    # Create a protocol for the Hugging Face finbert agent
    news_protocol = Protocol("Institute News")

    async def fetch_symbol(company_name):
        url = f"https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=SYMBOL_SEARCH&keywords={company_name}&apikey={ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            # Typically, the best match will be the first item in the bestMatches list
            if data.get('bestMatches') and len(data['bestMatches']) > 0:
                # Return the symbol of the best match
                symbol = data['bestMatches'][0]['1. symbol']
                return symbol
        return 'No Symbol found'

    async def analyze_news(company_name):
        """Analyze news sentiment for the company using GNews."""
        url = f"https://gnews.io/api/v4/search?q={company_name}&token={GNEWS_API_KEY}&lang=en"
        response = requests.get(url)
        articles = response.json().get('articles', [])

        # Extract URLs and convert them to hyperlinks
        url_list = []
        for article in articles:
            url = article.get("url", "No Url")
            if url != "No Url":
                url_list.append(f'<a href="{url}">{url}</a>')

        # Combine hyperlinks into a single string with line breaks
        hyperlinks_combined = '\n'.join(url_list)

        return hyperlinks_combined

    @news_protocol.on_message(model=NewsRequest, replies=UAgentResponse)
    async def on_news_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: NewsRequest):
        ctx.logger.info(msg.company_name)
        symbol = await fetch_symbol(msg.company_name)
        ctx.logger.info(symbol)
        news_content = await analyze_news(symbol)
        ctx.logger.info(news_content)
        await ctx.send(sender, UAgentResponse(message=news_content, type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL))

    agent.include(news_protocol)
    ```

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      Remember that you need to get a `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` Key from [GNews ↗️](https://gnews.io/) to correctly run this example.
    </Callout>

    The script integrates two key concepts: **fetching data from APIs** and **formatting the response with rich text** (specifically, HTML hyperlinks). We first import the needed libraries and then define the `NewsRequest` Data Model. This takes in a `company_name` as input, which will be used to fetch relevant data from GNews. We proceed and define a communication [protocol ↗️](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/agent-protocols) within the DeltaV agent named `Institute News`. Protocols are used to handle specific types of messages or requests, in this case, news-related requests about a company. We go on and define 3 different functions:

        1. `fetch_symbol()`: This asynchronous function retrieves the stock symbol for a company using the Alpha Vantage API. The function constructs a URL with the company name and API key, sends a request, and parses the response. If a match is found, it returns the best-matching symbol. If not, it returns `No Symbol found`.
        2. `analyze_news()`: This function fetches news articles related to the company using the GNews API. The function processes the list of articles, extracts their URLs, and formats each URL as a clickable hyperlink using the HTML `<a>` tag. The hyperlinks are then combined into a single string, with each link on a new line, and returned.
        3. `on_news_request()`: This is the main function that handles incoming requests based on the NewsRequest model. When a request is received, it logs the company name, fetches the company’s stock symbol, retrieves and formats the news articles as hyperlinks, and sends the final response back to the sender. The response includes the rich text (formatted hyperlinks) as the message content.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Use HTML tags to format text as rich text. For example, use `<b>` for bold, `<i>` for italics, and `<u>` for underline. Embed hyperlinks using the `<a>` tag.

      Example:

        ```
        <a href="https://example.com">Click here to visit Example.com</a>
        ```

      When users click on **Click here to visit Example**, they will be taken to `https://example.com`.

    </Callout>

## Conclusions

This guide details how to enhance DeltaV responses using rich text and hyperlinks. Rich text allows for enhanced formatting of responses, while hyperlinks make content interactive by providing clickable links to additional resources. The example code demonstrates how to fetch data from APIs, format it with HTML links, and handle requests within a DeltaV agent. Proper use of these features improves readability, engagement, and the overall effectiveness of your responses.
