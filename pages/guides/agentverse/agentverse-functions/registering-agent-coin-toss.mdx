# Agentverse Functions: register a coin toss agent as a Function

## Introduction

In the [Agentverse Functions: register your Functions on the Agentverse! ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services) guide, you have gotten familiar with the creation of an agent that can be registered as a Function and then be used in [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav).

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Check out the [Functions ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-functions) guide for additional information needed for Agent Functions and their registration on the Agentverse and Fetch network.
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Check out the [AI Engine package ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents-ai-engine/) to download it and start integrating your Agents with this tool!

      Current version of the AI Engine package is <PackageVersion packageName="uagents-ai-engine" packageType="pypi" />
    </Callout>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have read the following resources before going on with this guide:

    - [Quick Start Guide for uAgents Framework ↗️](/guides/agents/quickstart)
    - [Creating your first agent ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/create-a-uagent)
    - [Agents address ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/getting-uagent-address)
    - [Almanac contract ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/almanac)
    - [Register in Almanac ↗️](/guides/agents/register-in-almanac)
    - [Agent Functions ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-functions)
    - [Make your agents AI Engine compatible ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/ai-engine-compatible-agent)
    - [Field descriptions for DeltaV ↗️](/guides/agentverse/agentverse-functions/field-descriptions-for-deltav)

## Create your coin toss agent!

For this navigate to the [Agentverse: My Agents ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/agents) tab and click on the **+ New Agent** button:

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss/hosted-agent-use-case-button.png)

When the dialog is open, select the **Toss a Coin** use case:

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss/use-case-dialog.png)

A new agent will be created for you:

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss/hosted-agent-in-list.png)

## Run your coin toss agent!

After clicking on the row of your newly created agent, you should be able to see the source code of your coin toss agent in the editor view:

    ```python copy filename="agent.py"
    # Here we demonstrate how we can create a simple coin toss agent that is compatible with DeltaV.

    # After running this agent, it can be registered to DeltaV on Agentverse My Agents tab. For registration you will have to use the agent's address.

    import random
    # third party modules used in this example
    from uagents import Field
    from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType


    class CoinToss(Model):
        choice: str = Field(description="The choice. Must be heads or tails.")

    coin_toss_protocol = Protocol("CoinToss")


    @coin_toss_protocol.on_message(model=CoinToss, replies={UAgentResponse})
    async def toss_coin(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: CoinToss):
        random_number = random.randint(0, 1)
        if random_number == 0:
            coin_tossed = "heads"
        else:
            coin_tossed = "tails"
        if coin_tossed == msg.choice:
            message = "You won!"
        else:
            message = "You lost!"
        await ctx.send(
            sender, UAgentResponse(message=message, type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL)
    )

    agent.include(coin_toss_protocol, publish_manifest=True)
    ````

Now click on the **Run** button in the upper right corner of the editor so that you have your coin toss agent up and running!

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss/run-hosted-agent.png)

## Register your coin toss agent function!

Similar to the this [guide ↗️](/guides/agentverse/agentverse-functions/registering-agent-services#register-your-agents-and-services), let's navigate to the [Agentverse: My Agents ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/) tab. Here, click on your agent to show the Agent Editor and then click on the **Deploy** tab to start registering your agent function.

After clicking the **+ New Function** button, you will need to provide all details required. Fill the form out as follows:

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss/new-service-dialog.png)

    - **Fucntion title**: just the name of your Agent Function. In this example let's call it **Coin toss function**
    - **Description**: Super important to be as detailed as you can, as reasoning engine looks at descriptions to understand what your Function does. In this example we can specify something like this: _Coin toss Function. Takes the "heads" or "tails" input from the user and based on it decides if the user won or lost._
    - **Application**, **Protocol**, **Model** and **Field descriptions** will be automatically populated based on the source code of [your coin toss agent ↗️](/guides/agentverse/agentverse-functions/registering-agent-coin-toss#run-your-coin-toss-agent)

## Let's find our service on DeltaV

Now, head to [DeltaV ↗️](https://deltav.agentverse.ai/) and sign in.

First, in the **What function would you like to assemble?** bar you can provide a predefined objective; let's type `Toss a coin`.

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      We encourage everyone operating on DeltaV to select the **Next Generation** AI Engine personality type. This AI Engine personality stands as a significant personality type offering _enhanced scalability_, _reliability_, and _flexibility_. The major key features include advanced context understanding, improved function recommendations, and the ability to handle multiple dialogue formats.
    </Callout>

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss/select-service-group.png)

After being redirected to the chat screen, you will be asked to select an option.
As your objective task (`Toss a coin`) specified on the previous screen contained words related to the [description of your coin toss agent ↗️](/guides/agentverse/agentverse-functions/registering-agent-coin-toss#run-your-coin-toss-agent), your Coin Toss Function is listed as an option.

Let's select it.

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss/select-task.png)

After selecting the task, you will be asked if you want to pick `heads` or `tails`. The [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) behind DeltaV asks this question based on the description. The choice must be heads or tails.

Select whichever option you feel like. In this case let's pick `heads`.

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss/select-option.png)

Then, you can confirm or reject the context that the AI Engine is planning to execute. Let's confirm it!

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss/confirm-context.png)

After your function has been executed you can see the `You won!` or `You lost!` message.

![](src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss/task-completed.png)

With that, **you have gotten a Coin Toss Function which can be discovered and contacted with DeltaV. Awesome!**
