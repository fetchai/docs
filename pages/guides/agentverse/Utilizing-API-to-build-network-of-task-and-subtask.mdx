# Using News API to build network of tasks and subtasks in Agentverse

## Introduction

This agent network helps users to read news of different types including Categorical, Country based or Keyword related news. There are three layers of services to let users read news. These services altogether return news of specific type and subtype based on user preference.

Three different layers of subtasks are included in this News Reading System, Generate News subtask, and Generate {news_type} subtasks. For workflow of user requests please refer below flow chart.

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/Utilizing-API-to-build-network-of-task-and-subtask/news-reading-system-flowchart.drawio.png)

## Task and Subtask

The task and subtask descriptions and names should be relevant to make it easy for the LLM to identify the type of subtask to trigger and when. Descriptions of tasks and subtasks should always indicate when specific subtasks should be triggered. In this case one of multiple subtasks is to be triggered, it should be provided in the dictionary to enhance the LLM's understanding. For instance, you can refer to the example below where the "Generate News" subtask triggers one of the "Generate news_type subtasks”  based on the user’s requirement.

Field description is another feature of services which should mention use of subtasks in a clear and concise way. Refer [Agentverse Services ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/services) for more details on tasks and subtasks.

## News API

Login to [News API ↗️](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines) and get your API key by logging in and registering for API. This API key will be used in agent scripts to fetch news related to a specific type and subtype.

## Agents

For this navigate to [your agents ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/agents) and click on the **New Agent** button. Click on blank agent and name them as mentioned in titles below:

### News Reading Agent

This agent helps users to **read news** according to their willingness. This agent triggers the news generating subtask and asks the user for the news type they want to read today. This agent responds to the final result to the deltaV GUI as well.

    ```python copy filename="agent.py"
        # Here we demonstrate how we can create a news reading system agent that is compatible with DeltaV.
        
        # After running this agent, it can be registered to DeltaV on Agentverse's Services tab. For registration you will have to use the agent's address. 

        # Import required libraries
        import requests
        import json
        from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType

        # Define News Reading Model
        class News(Model):
            news : str

        # Define Protocol for news reading system
        news_protocol = Protocol("News System")

        # Define a handler for the News system protocol
        @news_protocol.on_message(model=News, replies = UAgentResponse)
        async def on_news_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: News):
            #splitting the news titles with nnn and enumerating them with line break for visually better results
            result_list = msg.news.split(" nnn ")
            final_news = '\n'.join([f"{i + 1}. {title}" for i, title in enumerate(result_list)])
            #Printing the news response on logger
            ctx.logger.info(f"Received news request from {sender} with prompt: {final_news}")
            #sending final response to the DeltaV GUI
            await ctx.send(sender, UAgentResponse(message = final_news, type = UAgentResponseType.FINAL))

        # Include the Generate News protocol in your agent
        agent.include(news_protocol)
    ```
Now click on the **Run** button in the upper right corner of the editor so that you have your news system agent agent up and running!

### News Generating Agent

This agent asks users for the type of news they want to read today from options like categorical, Country related or keyword related. It then directs the user request to relevant subtasks to generate that type of news and respond it back to the News Reading system.

    ```python copy filename="agent.py"
        # Here we demonstrate how we can create a news generating agent that is compatible with DeltaV.
        
        # After running this agent, it can be registered to DeltaV on Agentverse's Services tab. For registration you will have to use the agent's address. 

        # Import required libraries
        import requests
        import json
        from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType

        # Define News Generating Model
        class GenerateNews(Model):
        news_type: str
        news : str

        # Define Generate news protocol
        generate_news_protocol = Protocol("Generate News")

        # Define a handler for the News generation protocol
        @generate_news_protocol.on_message(model=GenerateNews, replies=UAgentResponse)
        async def on_generate_news_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: GenerateNews):

            try:
            # Generate news based on the requested category
                ctx.logger.info('Generating News')
                ctx.logger.info(f'User have selected {msg.news_type} category')
       
                ctx.logger.info(f'Generate News \n {msg.news}')
                message = msg.news
            # Send a successful response with the generated news
            await ctx.send(
                sender,
                UAgentResponse(
                    message= message,
                    type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL
                    )
                    )
            # Handle any exceptions that occur during news generation
            except Exception as exc:
                ctx.logger.error(f"Error in generating  news: {exc}")
            
            # Send an error response with details of the encountered error
                await ctx.send(
                    sender,
                    UAgentResponse(
                        message=f"Error in generating news: {exc}",
                        type=UAgentResponseType.ERROR
                        )
                        )

        # Include the 'Generate News' protocol in your agent
        agent.include(generate_news_protocol)
    ```
Now click on the **Run** button in the upper right corner of the editor so that you have your news system agent agent up and running!

### Generate Categorical News

After being navigated to the chat screen, you will be asked to select a task (service).
As your objective (`I want to read news`) specified on the previous screen contained words related to the [description of your news reading system agent ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-news-reading-agent#News-Reading-System), your News Reading System service is listed as an option.
Let's select it.

Subtask Generate News Subtask will be triggered once we select News Reading System and it will provide options as mentioned in [field description ↗️] (/guides/agentverse/registering-news-reading-agent#Generate-News-Subtask) for Generate news subtask.
Select the news type you want to read.

Once you select the news type respective subtask will be triggered as mentioned in [task description ↗️] (/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss#Generate-News-Subtask) for Generate news_type subtask.
The respective Generate news_type subtask will ask for category, country or keyword based on news type selected and will generate top 10 news related to news subtype provided.

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/Utilizing-API-to-build-network-of-task-and-subtask/generate-news-type-subtask-3.png)

The news will be passed from Generate news_type subtask > Generate News Subtask > News reading system.

With that, **you have got a news reading service which can be discovered and contacted with DeltaV. Awesome!**

**Note :** If one of multiple subtask is to be triggered, it should be mentioned in dictionary rather than writing a description of each as it confuses the DeltaV LLM model. If we mention **"Trigger generate categorical subtask for user selecting categorical news and trigger generate regional for user selecting regional news and so on...."**, will lead to either untracability of subtask or wrong selection of subtasks.
