# Utilizing the Agentverse Mailroom service üì¨

## Introduction

The **Agentverse Mailroom** assists you in setting up mailboxes for local and Agentverse agents, allowing them to have a two-way communication with each other without the need to be constantly online and without requiring your constant presence to operate. In addition to utilizing the **Mailroom**, there exists a more straightforward method for establishing one-way communication from a local agent to an Agentverse agent.

**We will show both methods in this guide**.

## Agentverse and local agents

Facilitating communication between Agentverse agents and local agents can be achieved through two methods:

    - **Direct recipient address**: you can simply initiate communication by specifying the recipient address of the Agentverse agent in the local agent setup.

    - **Mailbox communication**: to establish communication between Agentverse agents and local agents through the mailbox, your local agents will use the Agentverse URL and API key to collect messages.

## Direct communication
### Local agent setup

Let's now start by creating a local agent named `alice` with a `send_message()` function using an `@agent.on_interval()` decorator to send messages to the Agentverse agent every 5 seconds. You can leave `AGENTVERSE_AGENT_ADDRESS` empty for now until you create your Agentverse agent in the next step:

    ```py copy
    from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
    from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

    class Message(Model):
        message: str

    alice = Agent(
        name="alice",
        seed="alice secret seed phrase",
    )

    fund_agent_if_low(alice.wallet.address())

    AGENTVERSE_AGENT_ADDRESS = "put_agentverse_agent_address_here"

    @alice.on_interval(period=5.0)
    async def send_message(ctx: Context):
        """Send a message to agentverse agent every 5 seconds."""
        ctx.logger.info("Sending message to agentverse uAgent")
        await ctx.send(AGENTVERSE_AGENT_ADDRESS, Message(message="hello there!!"))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        alice.run()
   ```
### Agentverse agent setup

Now create an Agentverse agent `bob` by selecting **+ Agent** in the **My Agents** tab in the [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://agentverse.ai/). Then, add the following code to it:

    ```py copy
    class Message(Model):
        message: str

    @bob.on_message(model=Message)
    async def handle_message(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")
   ```

Next, run **bob** on the Agentverse. Copy `bob`'s address and paste it on `alice`'s local setup, under the `AGENTVERSE_AGENT_ADDRESS` field. Finally, run your local agent and you will see `alice`'s local agent messages printed on `bob`'s Agentverse terminal (i.e. the **Agents Logs**).

## Mailbox communication

### Local agent setup

To register agents in the **Agentverse Mailbox service**:

    1. First of all, you need to sign in at the [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://agentverse.ai/).

    2. After signing in, you need to head towards the upper right corner and click on your profile icon and select **API Keys**. Select **Create new key** and give it a name. This will generate your own **API Key** that will allow you to use the Mailbox server.

    3. You would then need to navigate to the **Mailroom** tab and select **+ Mailbox** to register an agent. First, you need to select a name for it and provide the agent's address. Finally, you will then need to include the **Mailbox Server** and **API key** just created within the script for your agent so for your registered agents to start communicating with it. This can be added to your local agent in the following way:

        ```py copy
        # First generate a secure seed phrase (e.g. https://pypi.org/project/mnemonic/)
        SEED_PHRASE = "put_your_seed_phrase_here"

        # Copy the address shown below
        print(f"Your agent's address is: {Agent(seed=SEED_PHRASE).address}")

        # Then sign up at https://agentverse.ai to get an API key and register your agent
        API_KEY = "put_your_API_key_here"

        # Now your agent is ready to join the agentverse!
        alice = Agent(
            name="alice",
            seed=SEED_PHRASE,
            mailbox=f"{API_KEY}@wss://agentverse.ai",
        )
        ```

    4. Now, let's finish the setup for our local agent `alice` by importing the necessary classes and adding functionalities for sending and receiving messages:

        ```py copy
        from uagents import Agent, Context, Model
        from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low

        class Message(Model):
            message: str

        BOB_ADDRESS = "paste_bob_address_here"

        SEED_PHRASE = "put_your_seed_phrase_here"

        print(f"Your agent's address is: {Agent(seed=SEED_PHRASE).address}")

        API_KEY = "put_your_API_key_here"

        alice = Agent(
            name="alice",
            seed=SEED_PHRASE,
            mailbox=f"{API_KEY}@wss://agentverse.ai",
        )

        fund_agent_if_low(alice.wallet.address())

        @alice.on_interval(period=2.0)
        async def send_message(ctx: Context):
            ctx.logger.info("Sending message to bob")
            await ctx.send(BOB_ADDRESS, Message(message="hello there bob"))

        @alice.on_message(model=Message, replies=set())
        async def on_message(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
            ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            alice.run()

       ```
### Agentverse agent setup

    1. Let's create a new Agentverse agent `bob` by selecting **+ Agent** in the **My Agents** tab in the [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://agentverse.ai/).

    2. Then, you would need to add the following code to `bob`'s script:

        ```py copy
        class Message(Model):
            message: str

        @agent.on_message(model=Message)
        async def handle_message(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Message):
            ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

            await ctx.send(sender, Message(message="hello there alice"))
        ```

    3. Next, you need to copy `bob`'s address and define it within `alice`'s code under `BOB_ADDRESS` field.

    4. Once you've done this, run Agentverse agent `bob` on the [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://agentverse.ai/) followed by your local agent, `alice`. You will then be able to send messages back and forth between the two agents, which will be displayed on both `alice`'s and `bob`'s terminals.
