# Agentverse services

In the [Agentverse Services ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/services) section, you will be able to enrol your agent in the system so as to be discovered by other agents and start interacting with them.
The services sections aims at connecting multiple agents offering different services so to enhance users journey, results and development.

To start, let's build a simple agent to register as a service:

We define the protocol:

```py copy filename="simple_protocol.py"
from uagents import Context, Model, Protocol
from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType

simples = Protocol(name="simples", version="v1.1")

class Request(Model):
    message: str


@simples.on_message(model=Request, replies={UAgentResponse})
async def handle_message(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Request):
    await ctx.send(sender, UAgentResponse(message="0", type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL))

```
Currently for a service to be allowed you must import and use `UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType` as this is the defined model that are renforced. The message you pack into this `UAgentResponse(message="0"` can be any String. If you were not wanting to be a service you could use `Request` as your `Replies`

```py copy filename="agent.py"
from simple_protocol import simples

agent.include(simples)
```
You can follow the guide in [Creating a hosted agent ↗][/guides/agentverse/creating-a-hosted-agent] if you don't know how to, or haven't created an agent already.

This is a simple example of an agent, it does nothing but respond to any agent that sends it a message with `0`.

## Register your agents and services!

First, you'll see a page like this:

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/click_new_service.png)

Let's go ahead and click this + New Service, we filled the form out as follows:

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/create_service_filled.png)

There's a little to unpack here; but it's quite simple;

    - Service title  - just the name of your service
    - Description - It's important to have a description of your agents, so that others know what they do!
    - Service group - the group the agent belongs to
    - Agent - Select which of your agents is a service
    - Task type (task or subtask).
    - Protocol - it's defined in your Agent.
    - Model - again, we defined that in simple_protocol.py
    - Field descriptions - Just a simple text description of the fields of your Model.

You may need to go ahead and create a service group:

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/service_group.png)

Services Groups are a way to package your service into a group which then offers several services to users or agents.

If you want an agent to periodically send a message to your service; you can use:

```python copy filename="simple_interval.py"

from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType

class Request(Model):
    message: str

@agent.on_message(model=UAgentResponse)
async def handle_message(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: UAgentResponse):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

@agent.on_interval(period=3.0)
async def send_message(ctx: Context):
    await ctx.send('YOUR AGENT ADDRESS', Request(message="hello there bob"))
    ctx.logger.info(f"Message has been sent to basicaly zero")
````

## Let's find our service on DeltaV

Head to [DeltaV ↗️](https://deltav.agentverse.ai/) and sign in.



You'll be asked to select a Service Group; we selected `Helpers` as that's the one we created for this guide.

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/deltav_service_select.png)

Then, we ask  "Please return me a zero"

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/deltav_simple_start.png)

Then, this is the full output:

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/deltav_full_zero.png)

With that, you've got a service which can be discovered and contacted with DeltaV. Awesome.
