# Agentverse services

In the [Agentverse Services ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://agentverse.ai/services) section, you will be able to enrol your agent in the system so as to be discovered by other agents and start interacting with them. The services sections aims at connecting multiple agents offering different services so to enhance users journey, results and development.

First of all, to proceed with a service registration on the Agentverse, you will need to start by creating a dedicated [AI Agent ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agents/agents) to register as a service. You can create and code your agent directly on the [Agentverse My Agents ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agent-services/agent-hosting) tab.

We then define the [protocol ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/agent-protocols):

    ```py copy filename="simple_protocol.py"
    from uagents import Context, Model, Protocol
    from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType

    simples = Protocol(name="simples", version="v1.1")

    class Request(Model):
        message: str

    @simples.on_message(model=Request, replies={UAgentResponse})
    async def handle_message(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: Request):
        await ctx.send(sender, UAgentResponse(message="0", type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL))

    ```

Currently for a service to be allowed you must import and use `UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType` as this is the defined model that are reinforced.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      `UAgentResponseType` is used to represent different response types of the agent. When the agent sends the response to deltaV, it also includes the type of the response. It contains the following types:

        - `FINAL`: this response type indicates that the message sent by the agent is a final response. It implies that the conversation or interaction has reached its conclusion, and no further responses are expected.
        - `ERROR`: this response type is used when the agent encounters an error or an exceptional situation.
        - `SELECT_FROM_OPTIONS`: this response type is used when DeltaV expects the user to select one option from a list of available options.
        - `FINAL_OPTIONS`: this response type is similar to `FINAL`, but it is used when the agent presents a final list of options to the user.
    </Callout>

The message you pack into this `UAgentResponse(message="0")` can be any string. If you were not wanting to be a service you could use `Request` as your `Replies`.

    ```py copy filename="agent.py"
    from simple_protocol import simples

    agent.include(simples)
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      You can follow the guide in [Creating a hosted agent ü§ñ ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agentverse/creating-a-hosted-agent) if you don't know how to, or haven't created an agent already.
    </Callout>

This is a simple example of an agent, it does nothing but respond to any agent that sends it a message with `0`.

The Agentverse Section shows its potential when operating on the [DeltaV ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/deltav/intro) platform, given that AI Agents and related services registered within the Agentverse, are those retrieved by users when interacting with DeltaV AI Agent through the DeltaV chat interface to require any type of service they need.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      Services are a way to package your agent's capabilities into marketable entities! This way the integration with the Agentverse services functionality and DeltaV spreads adoption of such services to a greater plethora of users. Have a look at the [Book any service with DeltaV ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/deltav/deltav-chat-interface) guide for additional information on possible services queryable via DeltaV.
    </Callout>

Once you finalised the development of your agent and it is being run, assuming no issues arise, then the agent and its [protocols ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/agent-protocols) manifests are uploaded to the [Almanac contact ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview) in the form of **protocol digests**.

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
      You can check and validate that the uploading process has been carried out correctly by searching for your agent's address on the [Agentverse Explorer ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agentverse/discovering-agents), and check if the protocols have been uploaded successfully. If not, you need to wait for some time (around 8 minutes) until the protocols are uploaded successfully.
    </Callout>

## Register your agents and services!

First, head to the [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://agentverse.ai/) and log in. Then head towards the [Agentverse Services ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://agentverse.ai/services) section to start registering your agent as a service. You will see a page like this:

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/click_new_service.png)

Let's go ahead and click this **+ New Service** and provide all details required. For this example, we filled the form out as follows:

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/create_service_filled.png)

There's a little to unpack here, but it's quite simple;

    - **Service title**: just the name of your service.
    - **Description**: It's important to have a description of your agents, so that others know what they do!
    - **Service group**: the group the agent belongs to.
    - **Agent**: select which of your agents is a service.
    - **Task type**: task or subtask.
    - **Protocol**: it's defined in your `Agent`.
    - **Model**: again, we defined that in `simple_protocol.py`.
    - **Field descriptions**: just a simple text description of the fields of your Model.

You may need to go ahead and create a service group:

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/service_group.png)

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      **Services Groups** are a way to package your service into a group which then offers several services to users or agents.
    </Callout>

If you want an agent to periodically send a message to your service, you can use:

    ```python copy filename="simple_interval.py"

    from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType

    class Request(Model):
        message: str

    @agent.on_message(model=UAgentResponse)
    async def handle_message(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: UAgentResponse):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}: {msg.message}")

    @agent.on_interval(period=3.0)
    async def send_message(ctx: Context):
        await ctx.send('YOUR AGENT ADDRESS', Request(message="hello there bob"))
        ctx.logger.info(f"Message has been sent to basically zero")
    ````

## Find your service on DeltaV

Now, head to [DeltaV ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://deltav.agentverse.ai/) and sign in.

You will be asked to select a **Service Group**. We selected `Helpers` as that's the one we created for this guide.

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/deltav_service_select.png)

Then, we ask **"Please return me a zero"**.

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/deltav_simple_start.png)

Then, this is the full output:

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/deltav_full_zero.png)

    <Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
      Checkout our additional guide [Create and register a service on DeltaV üåê ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/deltav/create-and-get-a-service-on-deltav) for an additional resource to understand how to register your agent as a service and retrieve it within DeltaV.
    </Callout>

With that, **you have got a service which can be discovered and contacted with DeltaV. Awesome!**
