# CI with AVCTL and github actions

This guide explains how we deploy an agent, or update a deployed agent on agentverse using AVCTL.

## Structure

We have a [github repo](https://github.com/fetchai/avctl-ci-example) where you can clone this code.

It is made up of three parts, but really two we have our deployment scripts in .github/workflows and in scripts/ and our agen is under agent/.

```
├── README.md
├── .github
│    └── workflows
│        └── deploy-agent.yaml
├── agent
│    ├── README.md
│    ├── agent.py
│    ├── poetry.lock
|    └── pyproject.toml
└── scripts
    └── deploy-agent.sh
```

This logic is very simple, we have a github workflow that triggers when the branch main is updated. It then call the
deployment script in `scripts/deploy-agent.sh`, this script works as follows:

Check if the agent already has an address defined in `.avctl/config.toml`, if it does is this agent registered? If
it isn't, let's register this agent. If it is registered let's stop this agent and sync it.

You can see the deplot script below, or on [github](https://github.com/fetchai/avctl-ci-example/blob/main/scripts/deploy-agent.sh)

	    # Check if the address is not empty

	# Change to the specified agent directory
	cd "$defined_directory"
	
	# Create a .staging.avctl folder for new agents if it doesn't exist
	avctl hosting init
	
	# get the agent address if it exists
	agent_address=$(get_agent_address)
	
	# Get the agent's name from the README.md top line header
	agent_name=$(head -n 1 README.md | sed -e 's/#//g' | xargs)
	
	
	# If the address exists...
	if [ -n "$agent_address" ]; then
	  avctl hosting get agent -a "$agent_address"
	  response=$(avctl hosting get agent -a "$agent_address")\
	
	  # Check if the agent is already in existence, if it isn't, deploy as new, else sync.
	  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
	    avctl hosting stop -a "$agent_address"
	    avctl hosting sync -a "$agent_address"
	  else
	    avctl hosting deploy -n "$agent_name" --no-dependency-check || true
	  fi
	# Agent doesn't exist, so let's deploy
	else
	  avctl hosting deploy -n "$agent_name" --no-dependency-check || true
	fi

## Getting started

Head on over to [agentverse.ai](https://agentverse.ai) and sign in, under your profile link (top right) there is an
option for `API Keys`:

<ImageByTheme
  darkSrc={agentverse_secret}
  lightSrc={agentverse_secret}
  alt="agentverse_secret"
/>

Click this take syou to an API Key window, here click new `+ New API Key`, give the key a name and give this api key
full permissions. Click generate API Key at the bottom of the page, and copy the output. Detailed instructions can
also be found [here](/guides/apis/agent-function-creation-apis#how-to-get-agentverse-api-tokens)

Once you've got your API_KEY, be sure to have forked the [github repo](https://github.com/fetchai/avctl-ci-example),
and visit that repo. Go to settings, on the left hand menu select Secrets and variables, and click actions from the
drop down. You'll get a window like shown below:

<ImageByTheme
  darkSrc={github_secret}
  lightSrc={github_secret}
  alt="github_secret"
/>

Click New Repository secret and enter the API_KEY, we have named ours `AGENTVERSE_API_KEY`.

Great with that set, copy in your agent code under agent. It is assumed here that your agent is tested, and you have
an account on agentverse.

Now, let's push:

```
git add .
git commit -m "updating agent"
git push
```
Vistit your forked repo github page, and under actions you should see the runner in action:

<ImageByTheme
  darkSrc={action}
  lightSrc={action}
  alt="action of github runner"
/>

### Possible error

You may need to locally run:

```
sudo git update-index --chmod=+x scripts/deploy-agent.sh
```

This tells git to update the permission on the executable script. Then push up the changes for them to take effect.

## Running this locally:

Please follow the installation guide [here](guides/agentverse/avctl/avctl#installation)

Update the permissions on deploy-agent.sh (You should only need to do this once):

```
chmod +x scripts/deploy-agent.sh
```

Login to agentverse from terminal:

```
avctl auth login
```

Then from terminal run:

```
./scripts/deploy-agent.sh
```

You should see output similar too, dependent on your agents deployed state:

```
josh@vm avctl-ci-example % ./scripts/deploy-agent.sh
Project already initialized
Agent exists on agentverse under address: 'agent1qfx5mmewjs4x9ysyxemsaxv6empds4mmpx4sav84yagmhed5yczdwtqkcxu'
Agent agent1qfx5mmewjs4x9ysyxemsaxv6empds4mmpx4sav84yagmhed5yczdwtqkcxu has been stopped.
Pushing latest code...
Everything is up to date. Nothing to push
Agent agent1qfx5mmewjs4x9ysyxemsaxv6empds4mmpx4sav84yagmhed5yczdwtqkcxu is now running!
josh@vm avctl-ci-example %

```

## Quirks

Agentvese for security defines your agent address and stores your private key. An address you set locally will not be applied on agentverse using the above method.

## Further steps

To get familiar with AVCTl we recommend reading the other guides in this series: [avctl](guides/agentverse/avctl/avctl), [avct hosting](guides/agentverse/avctl/avctl-hosting).
