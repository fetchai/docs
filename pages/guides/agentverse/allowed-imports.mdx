## Multi-file Support:

The Agentverse code editor enhances your agent development experience with multi-file support, enabling you to tackle complex projects with ease. Leverage this feature to:

    - **Interact between files**: simply import functions, classes, and variables from one file to another.
    - **Modular development**: divide your projects into manageable components for streamlined creation.
    - **Code reuse**: utilize modules across various sections of your project for efficient development.
    - **Enhanced organization**: maintain a structured and organized codebase for easier maintenance.

If you want to create **new files** you just need to click on **+ New File** on [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/) inside your managed agent.
