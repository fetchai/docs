# Register a dice roll agent as a service

In the [previous section ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss) you have got familiar with the creation of a coin toss agent that can be registered as a service and then can be used in [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav).

In this example we are going to try out another use case - dice roll agent.

## Create your dice roll agent!

For this navigate to [your agents ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/agents) and click on the **Use case** button:

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss/hosted-agent-use-case-button.png)

When the dialog is open, select the **DeltaV compatible Dice Roll Agent** use case:

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll/use-case-dialog.png)

Now a new agent has been created for you:

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll/hosted-agent-in-list.png)

## Run your dice roll agent!

After clicking on the row of your newly created agent, you should be able to see the source code of your dice roll agent in the editor view:

    ```python copy filename="agent.py"
        # Here we demonstrate how we can create a simple dice roll agent that is compatible with DeltaV.

        # After running this agent, it can be registered to DeltaV on Agentverse's Services tab. For registration you will have to use the agent's address. 
        #
        import random
        # third party modules used in this example
        from pydantic import Field
        from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType


        class DiceRoll(Model):
            num_rolls: int = Field(description="Number of rolls.")

        dice_roll_protocol = Protocol("DiceRoll")


        @dice_roll_protocol.on_message(model=DiceRoll, replies={UAgentResponse})
        async def roll_dice(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: DiceRoll):
            result = ", ".join([str(random.randint(1, 6)) for _ in range(msg.num_rolls)])
            message = f"Dice roll results: {result}"
            await ctx.send(
                sender, UAgentResponse(message=message, type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL)
        )

        agent.include(dice_roll_protocol, publish_manifest=True)
    ````
Now click on the **Run** button in the upper right corner of the editor so that you have your dice roll agent up and running!

## Register your dice roll agent!

Similar to the [previous section ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss#register-your-coin-toss-agent) let's navigate to the [Agentverse Services ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/services) section to start registering your agent as a service.

After clicking the **+ New Service** button provide all details required - fill the form out as follows:

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll/new-service-dialog.png)

    - **Service title**: just the name of your service - in this example let's call it **Dice roll service**
    - **Description**: Super important to be as detailed as you can, as reasoning engine looks at descriptions to understand what your service does - in this example we can specify something like this: **Dice roll service that rolls a dice. The number of rolls is specified by the user.**
    - **Service group**: the group the to be created service belongs to - If you already have the **Use case** service group created in the [previous coin toss example ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss#register-your-coin-toss-agent) select that. If you haven't created a service group click on the **Add new Service Group** option and let's create a service group with the name **Use case**.
    - **Agent**: select your newly created **deltav compatible dice roll agent** agent from the list
    - **Task type**, **Protocol**, **Model** and **Field descriptions** will be automatically populated based on the source code of [your dice roll agent ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll#run-your-dice-roll-agent)

## Let's find our service on DeltaV

Now, head to [DeltaV ↗️](https://deltav.agentverse.ai/) and sign in.

First you will be asked to **Select a service group**. Let's select the `Use case` service group in the dropdown positioned on the upper right part of the screen as that's the one we created for this guide.
After that in the **Select an objective** section you can use a predefined objective, but let's click on the **Something else** option and type `Dice a roll`.

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll/select-service-group.png)

After being navigated to the chat screen, you will be asked to select a task (service).
As your objective (`Dice a roll`) specified on the previous screen contained words related to the [description of your dice roll agent ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll#register-your-dice-roll-agent), your DiceRoll service is listed as an option.
Let's select it.

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll/select-task.png)

After selecting the task, you will be asked about the number of rolls you want to do.
The AI engine behind DeltaV asks this question based on the description `Number of rolls.` that was specified in the [predefined use case before ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll#run-your-dice-roll-agent).
Send the number of rolls in the input field at the bottom of the screen - in this case let's stick with `10`.

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll/select-option.png)

Then, you can confirm or reject the context that the AI engine is planning to execute. Let's confirm it!

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll/confirm-context.png)

After your service has been executed you can see your dice roll results.

![](../../../src/images/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll/task-completed.png)

With that, **you have got a dice roll service which can be discovered and contacted with DeltaV. Awesome!**
