# Creating a hosted agent 🤖

## Introduction

On the [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/), within the [My Agents ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agent-hosting) section you are able to build and host any type of agent you wish to create. Bear in mind that managed agents are currently a beta feature and because of this, they do not fully support the complete [AI Agents ↗️](/concepts/agents/agents) toolset for development. Improvements and upgrades are foreseen in the future!

There are 2 different ways through which you can start creating your agents. You can either choose to build an agent:

    1.  From a blank script, by clicking on **+ Agents**.
    2.  From a specified use case, by clicking on **+ Use Case**.

## Creating an agent

You can create your AI Agent from a blank script by navigating towards the [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/), [sign in ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/getting-started) and choosing the **My Agents** tab. Here, click on the **+ Agents** button.

By choosing the **+ Agents** button, you will first need to provide a name for the agent you plan to build. For instance, let's create an agent named **alice**.

![](../../../src/images/agentverse/create-agent/agentverse-myagent_2.png)

Once you select it, your agent will be ready to be coded and a box will appear in the **My Agents** page with different data being displayed about the agent you have just created, including the agent's **name** and **address**.

![](../../../src/images/agentverse/create-agent/agentverse-myagent_3.png)

By clicking on this box, the code editor will appear allowing you to code your agent straightforwardly. This is the **Agent Editor**. You can use this editor to build the code for the agent you have in mind, edit, and refine it all in one place. The Agent Editor provides you with different fundamental information about your agent, including the **agent's address** and **wallet address**.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      For additional information on AI Agent address, have a look at our dedicated documentation: [Getting an agent addresses 🤖📫 ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-uagent-address)
    </Callout>

On the Agent Editor, there is a built-in **agent.py** file that enables you to start coding straight away! The Agent Editor provides you with the possibility of structuring your project into multiple file windows located on the left side of the Editor window. You just need to provide a name to the new file being added. An additional feature of the Agent Editor is that at the end of it you can find the **Agents Logs**, which is a built-in terminal displaying the output of your script after it is being run. When running the example above you will observe "Hello World!" printed on the terminal.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      This way, we aim at making agents' development as quick and efficient as possible. This is a great tool to determine if your code runs smoothly and to check if any error arises so for you to directly intervene and solve it if needed!

## Create your first agent on the Agentverse!

You are now ready to start using the Agentverse to create and edit your agents in few minutes! To begin with, you can create a simple agent printing **"Hello world!"** in the Agent Logs on an interval of 3 seconds by using the `.on_interval()` decorator.

Here's an example:

![](../../../src/images/agentverse/create-agent/agentverse-myagent_5.png)

To run the agent, simply click on the **Run** button. You can stop the script by clicking on the **Stop** button.

The output will be printed in the Agent Logs window.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Within the Agent Editor, you can import and utilize a predefined set of modules to develop your ideas. These pre-approved modules offer a diverse range of functionalities, allowing you to build complex agents. For further information on modules being available within the Agentverse code editor, have a look at the following resource: [Agentverse: allowed imports ↗️](/guides/agentverse/allowed-imports).
    </Callout>

## Create an agent based on a template

You can also create an agent by choosing **+ Use Case** button. In this case you will be able to create an agent based on a specific **template**.

![](../../../src/images/agentverse/create-agent/agentverse-myagent_7.png)

There are different categories you can choose from:

![](../../../src/images/agentverse/create-agent/agentverse-myagent_8.png)

    1. **Getting Started**: this category helps you in creating basic agents using the uAgents technology.
       You can:

           - Create your first agent.
           - Send messages between two agents.
           - Storing data.
           - Organize your agents with protocols.
           - Create an agent requesting data from a website.
           - Create an agent sending tokens to another agent.
           - Create an agent interacting with an oracle smart contract.

    2. **AI/ML**: this category allows you to develop AI/ML agents.

           You can choose to:

           - Create an agent requesting data from an AI model.

    3. **Smart Services**: this category is for building smart agents for different services.agent

           You can choose among:

           - **Weather Agents**: this allows you to develop agents retrieving weather data from weather services API.
           - **Weather Data Provider and Consumer Agents**: this use case allows you to create two different agents, one providing weather data and another one consuming such data.
           - **Weather Data Seller and Buyer Agents**: this use case allows you to create two different agents, one selling weather data and another one buying such data.
           - **Weather Oracle Provider and Consumer Agents**: this use case allows you to create two different agents, one updating an oracle contract with weather data and another one requesting such data to the oracle by paying a small fee.

    4. **DeltaV examples**: this category allows you to develop AI Agents offering different services which are then made available through the [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/deltav/intro) Chat. This agents and related services need to register within the dedicated [Agentverse Services ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services) tab so for them to be available for queries from users operating and interacting DeltaV AI Agent.

           You can choose to:

           - Create a DeltaV compatible agent requesting stock price of a share.

Let's assume you want to create your agent using the **Your first agent template**, from the **Getting Started** window.
Each template available presents a small number in the bottom right corner indicating the number of agents available for that particular template.

![](../../../src/images/agentverse/create-agent/agentverse-myagent_9.png)


Whenever you choose one of the templates available to start building your agent, in the Agent Editor you will see some additional information appearing when clicking on the use case chosen, alongside with the code needed to make it runnable.

![](../../../src/images/agentverse/create-agent/agentverse-myagent_10.png)

The output in this case would be the following:

![](../../../src/images/agentverse/create-agent/agentverse-myagent_11.png)

## Register Domain Name

You can also provide a **Web3 Agent Name** to your agent. To do so, just click on **+ Register Web3 Name** and fill in the dedicated field for this. This way, your agent will be given a unique name, making it easier for other agents to find and communicate with it.

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      The only requirement is _the name being in lowercase with no whitespaces in between_.
    </Callout>
