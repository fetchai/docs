# Creating a simple dice roll agent on Agentverse

## Introduction

The Agentverse provides multiple base templates you can use to start developing uAgents in a matter of seconds! You can do so by heading to the **My Agents** tab and click on **+ New Agent**. Here you can choose between a **Blank** agent and a **Skeleton** agent, which incorporates some predefined template you can use as a base point for code creation.

In this example we are going to try out the **Dice Roll Agent** use case.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have read the following resources before going on with this guide:

    - [Quick Start Guide for `uagents` Framework ↗️](/guides/agents/quickstart)
    - [Creating your first uAgent ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/create-a-uagent)
    - [uAgents address ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/getting-uagent-address)
    - [Almanac contract ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/almanac)
    - [Register in Almanac ↗️](/guides/agents/register-in-almanac)
    - [uAgents running on Agentverse ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/hosted-agent)

## Create your dice roll uAgent!

For this navigate to the [Agentverse: My Agents ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/agents) tab and click on the **Use case** button. When the dialog is open, select the **DeltaV compatible Dice Roll Agent** use case:

Now, a new uAgent has been created for you:

## Run your dice roll uAgent!

After clicking on the row of your newly created uAgent, you should be able to see the source code of your dice roll uAgent in the editor view:

    ```python copy filename="agent.py"
    # Here we demonstrate how we can create a simple dice roll uAgent that is compatible with DeltaV.

    # After running this uAgent, it can be registered to DeltaV on Agentverse My Agents tab. For registration you will have to use the uAgent's address.

    import random
    # third party modules used in this example
    from uagents import Field
    from ai_engine import UAgentResponse, UAgentResponseType

    class DiceRoll(Model):
        num_rolls: int = Field(description="Number of rolls.")

    dice_roll_protocol = Protocol("DiceRoll")


    @dice_roll_protocol.on_message(model=DiceRoll, replies={UAgentResponse})
    async def roll_dice(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: DiceRoll):
        result = ", ".join([str(random.randint(1, 6)) for _ in range(msg.num_rolls)])
        message = f"Dice roll results: {result}"
        await ctx.send(
            sender, UAgentResponse(message=message, type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL)
    )

    agent.include(dice_roll_protocol, publish_manifest=True)
    ````

Now click on the **Run** button in the upper right corner of the editor so that you have your dice roll uAgent up and running!

**Great! You have just created your uAgent starting from a predefined template in Agentverse!** You are now ready to understand how to enroll your uAgent on the Agentverse and make it retrievable by the [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) and subsequently [DeltaV↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav).

Check out the following resources to better grasps all of these concepts:
