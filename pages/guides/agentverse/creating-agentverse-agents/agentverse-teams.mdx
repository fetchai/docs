# Agentverse Teams

## Introduction

**Agentverse Teams** is a collaborative feature designed to support organizations and teams in developing Agent projects together on the Agentverse. Whether working on a hackathon or collaborating on a long-term project, the Teams feature allows multiple users to straightforwardly create and share Agents within members of the same group. Indeed, Team members can view, edit, and collaborate on any Agent created by any other members, thus facilitating the Agent application development process.

The Agentverse simplifies project management by centralizing access to all Team Agents and resources, making it easier to track progress and coordinate tasks. This functionality provides greater flexibility as Team owners can control access while ensuring new members can quickly get onboarded. This functionality is valuable during hackathons and events, where rapid interactions and real-time collaboration are crucial for deploying solutions quickly and effectively. 

The Agentverse Teams feature fosters a collaborative approach while supporting shared learning and skill development among Team members.

Here, you can view multiple information about your Team, its members and the Agents. First of all, you can check Team members, their role, status and when they joined. You can also remove users from your Team by clicking on the dedicated button within the more options menu on the right side of the Team member's box.

Additionally, you can browse Agents created and modified by any Team member. You can view the full list of Agents by clicking on the _View all_ link close to the _Agents_ box.

Finally, If you are the Team owner you can invite new members by using the dedicated _+ Add Member_ button.

**Switching back to your personal account will restrict your view to only your personal Agents, which you can continue to develop independently.**
