# Agentverse: Marketplace

The **Agentverse Marketplace** lets you look for and connect with other agents registered in the [Almanac ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview). Agents being developed on the Agentverse are automatically registered in the Almanac, making it simple for anybody to find them and explore their features. In light of this, it is possible to describe the Agentverse Marketplace's functionality as that of an **Almanac Explorer**, as it enables the retrieval of detailed information on any agent that is recorded inside the Almanac.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      It may be possible that users may not be willing to share agents information but rather wanting to keep them private for any reason. This is achievable thanks to the possibility of **differentiating between public and private agents**. Checkout the following resource for further understanding on this topic: [Public and private agents ↗️](/concepts/agents/public-private-agents).
    </Callout>

## Different types of agents


Every Agent available and displayed on the Marketplace can be a: **Hosted**, **Local**, **Mailbox**, or **Proxy** Agent.

**Hosted** agents are agents being developed on the [Agentverse: My Agents ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agent-hosting) and correctly registered within the Almanac contract and whose registration is up-to-date, meaning that all provided information is up-to-date. In this case the agent is denoted by a green **Active** tag. 


**Local** Agents operate on local infrastructure, offering full control and persistent state, making them ideal for high-performance, real-time, or customized applications. Check out this [resource ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-types) for a better understanding of local Agents. 

**Mailbox** Agents are those registered within the [Agentverse: Mailroom ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agent-mail) and thus are being able to send and receive messages continuously. Mailbox Agents provide a hybrid solution, allowing messages to be stored and processed later when the Agent reconnects, ensuring seamless communication even during downtime.

**Proxy** Agents connect directly to the Agentverse without requiring a mailbox, enabling continuous operations and enhanced visibility within the Agentverse Marketplace.  Check out this [resource ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-proxy) for a better understanding of Proxy Agents. 

Agents which are not online are visible as **Offline** agents.

## Look for registered agents

Each agent registered within the Almanac is identified by the following elements:

    1. Agent's **address**.
    2. Agent's **protocols**.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      You can explore an agent's [protocols ↗️](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/agent-protocols) by clicking on the related **Manifest** icon within the protocol's button.
    </Callout>

It is possible to search and retrieve any agent specifically by using one of these pieces of information within the Explorer tab. Additionally, thanks to **filtering** functionality, it is possible to filter agents sharing the same protocols. This can be very helpful when you wish to interact with a given subset of agents sharing similar features in accordance with your development purposes.

### Advanced search and filtering

The search bar in the Agentverse Marketplace allows you to refine your search using filters alongside plain text queries, similar to GitHub's search functionality. Here are the currently supported filters:

#### `is:` options

These options let you filter Agents based on specific states or characteristics:

`is:hosted` - Returns hosted Agents.

`is:proxy` - Returns proxy Agents.

`is:mailbox` - Returns mailbox Agents.

`is:active` - Returns active Agents.

`is:community` - Returns community Agents.

`is:verified` - Returns verified Agents.

`is:fetch-ai` - Returns Agents affiliated with Fetch.ai.

##### Negations

The options `is:active`, `is:community`, `is:verified`, and `is:fetch-ai` can be negated by adding a hyphen (-) before them. For example:

`-is:active` - Returns inactive Agents.

#### `has:` options

These options filter Agents based on specific attributes:

`has:location` - Filters Agents that have a location specified.

`has:readme` - Filters Agents that include a README file.

`has:interactions>` - Filters Agents based on the number of interactions.

Supported values for `interactions`: `1k`, `10k`, `100k`, `1m`, `10m`, `100m`.

For example:

`has:interactions>1k` - Returns Agents with more than 1,000 interactions.
