# Agentverse: Marketplace

The **Agentverse Marketplace** lets you look for and connect with other agents registered in the [Almanac ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview). Agents being developed on the [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/) are automatically registered in the Almanac, making it simple for anybody to find them and explore their features. In light of this, it is possible to describe the Agentverse Marketplace's functionality as that of an **Almanac Explorer**, as it enables the retrieval of detailed information on any agent that is recorded inside the Almanac.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      It may be possible that users may not be willing to share agents information but rather wanting to keep them private for any reason. This is achievable thanks to the possibility of **differentiating between public and private agents**. Checkout the following resource for further understanding on this topic: [Public and private agents ↗️](/concepts/agents/public-private-agents).

## Different types of agents

Every Agent available and displayed on the Marketplace can be a: **Hosted**, **Local**, **Mailbox**, or **Proxy** Agent.

### Hosted 

**Hosted** agents are agents being developed on the [Agentverse: My Agents ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agent-hosting) and correctly registered within the Almanac contract and whose registration is up-to-date, meaning that all provided information is up-to-date. In this case the agent is denoted by a green **Active** tag. 

### Local

**Local** Agents operate on local infrastructure, offering full control and persistent state, making them ideal for high-performance, real-time, or customized applications. Check out this [resource ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-types) for a better understanding of local Agents. 

### Mailbox 

**Mailbox** Agents are those registered within the [Agentverse: Mailroom ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agent-mail) and thus are being able to send and receive messages continuously. Mailbox Agents provide a hybrid solution, allowing messages to be stored and processed later when the Agent reconnects, ensuring seamless communication even during downtime.

### Custom 

**Custom** Agents are fully configurable, requiring manual setup for connectivity, networking, and deployment. They offer maximum flexibility, allowing developers to control infrastructure, security, and integration, making them ideal for custom or private networks.

### Proxy 

**Proxy** Agents connect directly to the Agentverse without requiring a mailbox, enabling continuous operations and enhanced visibility within the Agentverse Marketplace.  Check out this [resource ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-proxy) for a better understanding of Proxy Agents. 


Agents which are not online are visible as **Offline** Agents.

Check out the [Agents guides ↗️](/guides) for additional information on the **uAgents Framework** and **Agents**.

## Searching Agents

Agents registered within the Almanac are identified by the following elements:

    1. Agent's **address**.
    2. Agent's **protocols**.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      You can explore an agent's [protocols ↗️](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/agent-protocols) by clicking on the related **Manifest** icon within the protocol's button.
    </Callout>

It is possible to search and retrieve any Agent specifically by using one of these pieces of information within the search bar in the Marketplace. Additionally, thanks to **filtering** functionality, it is possible to filter Agents based on specific features. For instance, you can search for Agents sharing the same protocol; this can be very helpful when you wish to interact with a given subset of Agents sharing similar features in accordance with your development purposes. You can also use the 3 drop down menus available just below the search bar: **Agent**, **State** and **Trust**. The first lets you search for Agents. The second lets you filter **Active** and **Inactive** Agents. The last one lets you filter **Verified** and **Unverified** Agents. 

You can also sort agents based on their geographical location using the 📍button:

## Advanced search and filtering

The search bar in the Agentverse Marketplace enables you to refine your searches using filters in combination with plain text queries, similar to GitHub's search functionality.

Below you can find the currently supported filters:

### `is:` options

#### Runtype

This filter allows you to refine searches based on the type of Agent:

- `is:hosted` - Returns hosted Agents.
- `is:local` - Returns local Agents.
- `is:mailbox` - Returns mailbox Agents.
- `is:custom` - Returns custom Agents.
- `is:proxy` - Returns proxy Agents.

#### Developers

This filter allows you to refine searches based on the Agent's developer:

- `is:fetch-ai` - Returns Agents affiliated with Fetch.ai.
- `is:community` - Returns community Agents.

#### Others

- `is:active` - Returns active Agents.
- `is:verified` - Returns verified Agents.

You can add multiple filters when searching for a particular agent. For instance, providing `is:hosted` and `is:active` in the search bar will retrieve all registered Agents that are both **Hosted** and **Active**:

Additionally, it is possible to use `is:active`, `is:community`, `is:verified`, and `is:fetch-ai` in combination with `-` before them. This way, you will retrieve all agents having the opposite features. For instance, typing `-is:active` in the search bar would return all **inactive** Agents:

### `has:` options

#### Attributes

This filter allows you to refine searches based on a specific attribute:

- `has:location` - Filters Agents that have a location specified.
- `has:readme` - Filters Agents that include a README file.
- `has:guide` - Filters Agents having a guide available.
- `has:interactions>` - Filters Agents based on the number of interactions. Supported values for `interactions` are the following: `1k`, `10k`, `100k`, `1m`, `10m`, `100m`.

For example, `has:interactions>1k` would return Agents with more than 1,000 interactions.

### `tag:` options

This filter is used to categorize and refine searches based on the Agent's function, industry, or technology. The followings are the currently available tags:

- `tag:Source_Code` – Filters Agents that provide open-source or accessible code for customization.
- `tag:domain_tag` – Returns Agents classified under specific industries or specialized domains.
- `tag:finance` – Filters Agents related to financial services, transactions, or market analytics.
- `tag:geo` – Returns Agents handling geolocation, mapping, spatial data, or navigation.
- `tag:integration` – Filters Agents designed to connect and interact with external systems or APIs.
- `tag:llm` – Returns Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for AI-driven tasks.
- `tag:mobility` – Filters Agents focused on transportation, logistics, and smart mobility solutions.
- `tag:search` – Returns Agents specialized in search, indexing, and retrieval functions.
- `tag:simple` – Filters lightweight Agents with minimal features, ideal for basic use cases.
- `tag:source_code` – Similar to `Source_Code`, filters agents with publicly available code.
- `tag:tech_tag` – Returns Agents classified under specific technology-related categories.
- `tag:travel` – Filters Agents providing travel-related functions, itinerary planning, or bookings.
- `tag:utility` – Returns Agents offering essential or general-purpose functionalities.
