## Introduction

The μAgents (micro-Agents) project is a lightweight framework designed to facilitate the development of decentralized agents. μAgents are autonomous entities which interact, negotiate, and collaborate with other agents in a decentralized environment. μAgents provides developers with the tools and resources to create intelligent and self-governing systems that can efficiently operate across different fields and industries.
