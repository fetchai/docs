# μAgents protocols

The μAgents framework supports capturing related message types and handlers in **protocols**. Protocols are used to facilitate communication and interaction between μAgents in the μAgents framework. Any μAgent including the same protocol will be able to communicate with each other.

A **protocol** is built similar to a **μAgents**, but it has no identity and cannot be run. It contains only the message types and handlers that define some components of μAgents functionality.

To show how protocols work, have a look at the [storage](storage.md) and [Exchange protocol](exchange-protocol.md) resources and consider going through the **[Restaurant Booking Table Demo](booking-table-demo.md)**.
