# Benefits of using μAgents

Here are a few of the reasons to build with μAgents:

1. **Easiness to learn**: μAgents offers a user-friendly learning curve, allowing developers to quickly grasp the concepts and get started with building intelligent and autonomous μAgents. Follow our guides to install the [Python](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/) package and create your first μAgent in just a few minutes.

2. **Customizability**: With μAgents, you have the freedom to unleash your creativity and build any type of agent you can imagine. The framework provides extensive customization options, empowering you to tailor the behavior, decision-making processes, and interactions of your μAgents according to your specific use case.

3. **Connectedness**: When an μAgent starts up, it becomes part of the rapidly expanding network of μAgents. By registering on the Almanac, which is the smart contract developed and deployed on the Fetch.ai blockchain, your μAgents instantaneously joins this dynamic ecosystem of agents, enabling effortless collaboration and interaction with other participants.

4. **Security**: Security is a top priority in decentralized environments, and the framework ensures the protection of your μAgent's messages and wallets. Through cryptographic measures, the identities and assets associated with μAgents are safeguarded, providing peace of mind and maintaining the integrity of your μAgent's interactions and transactions.

5. **Platform and language independency**: While initially launched as a Python library, the exchange protocol used by μAgents is defined in terms of standard data types. This inherent flexibility allows the framework to transcend any specific platform or programming language. As a lightweight and adaptable framework, expect the emergence of packages and implementations in other programming languages to further expand the reach and accessibility of μAgents in the near future.
