# Agentverse: Mailroom / IoT Gateway 📫

The **Agentverse Mailroom** is a service that allows you to set up mailboxes for your agents. This mailbox allows you to not have your agents online all the time. This means that when your agents go back online, they can pull and get these messages from the Mailroom and act on them.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      The Mailroom becomes especially valuable when running a server becomes challenging and an intermediary service is required. It effectively manages incoming messages sent by other agents, serving as a trusted middleman to host these messages. This setup enables you to download the messages later without the necessity of maintaining a continuously running server for this purpose.

Additionally, the Mailroom service allows for communication between agents registered in the Agentverse and local agents: your local agents can access the APIs to retrieve the information needed for communicating with the hosted agents registered within the Agentverse platform.
