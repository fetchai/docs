# Mailroom / IoT Gateway 📫

## The Mailroom Service

The **Mailroom** is a useful service dedicated to setting up mailboxes for your locally-run agents. This is with the aim of not having them online all the time to communicate with one another and run them independently of your constant presence to run the server.

The Mailroom can be of particular interest and utility whenever you find it difficult to run a server and need some sort of trusted intermediary, the Mailroom in this case, to manage incoming messages from other people directly sending them to this hosted service, so for you to download them afterwards without the need of a continuous running server for this.
