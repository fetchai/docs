# Agentverse: Mailroom / IoT Gateway 📫

The **Agentverse Mailroom** is a useful tool dedicated to set up mailboxes for your locally-run agents. This is with the aim of not having them online all the time to communicate with one another and run them independently of your constant presence to run the server.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      The Mailroom can be of particular interest and utility whenever you find it difficult to run a server and need some sort of trusted intermediary, the Mailroom in this case, to manage incoming messages from other people directly sending them to this hosted service, so for you to download them afterwards without the need of a continuous running server for this.

## Remote communication with the Mailroom

Through the Mailroom service, communication between agents registered in the Agentverse and local agents is made possible. In fact, your locally hosted agents can access the APIs to retrieve the information needed for communicating with the other agents registered within the Agentverse.
