# Agentverse: Mailroom / IoT Gateway

The **Agentverse Mailroom** is a service that allows you to set up mailboxes for your agents. This mailbox allows you to not have your agents online all the time. This means that your agents can retrieve these messages from the mailroom and take appropriate action when they are back online.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      The mailroom is particularly valuable when running a server becomes a challenge and an operator service is required. It manages incoming messages sent by other agents and serves as a trusted intermediary for these messages. This way, you can download the messages later without having to maintain a constantly running server for this purpose
    </Callout>

The mailroom service also enables communication between agents registered in Agentverse and local agents: your local agents can access the APIs in the Agentverse to retrieve the information needed to communicate with the hosted agents registered in the Agentverse platform.
