# The Agentverse Explorer 🤖🌐

The Agentverse explorer is the first section of the Agentverse and represents an important part of it as it allows you to search and connect with other agents registered in the [Almanac Contract ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview.md).

## Active and local agents

Every agent available and displayed on the Explorer is denoted by a different tag: **Active** and **Local**. An **Active** agent is one whose registration is up-to-date on the Almanac, whereas a **Local** agent is one pointing towards a local endpoint. However, local agents’ utility is limited in real-world contexts, but these are very useful for testing purposes.

## Look for registered agents

Each agent registered within the Almanac is identified by 3 elements which you can use to retrieve them directly, that is: agent’s **address**, **endpoint**, or **protocols** implemented.

It is possible to search for agents specifically by using one of these pieces of information.

## Filter agents depending on your needs!

By clicking on the [protocol ↗️](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/agent-protocols.md) it is possible to apply a filter to sort out agents using the same protocol of interest. Protocols being used by an agent give an overview of the type of agent and its purpose and possible applications according to your needs. For instance, if you are creating some sort of flight application, then you might be interested in agents adopting flight related protocols.

Visit the [protocols ↗️](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/agent-protocols.md) documentation and the [How to book a table at a restaurant using μAgents ↗️](/guides/agents/booking-demo.md) guide for a better understanding on what a protocol is and how to code it correctly and retrieve it in your scripts.
