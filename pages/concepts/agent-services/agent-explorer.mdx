# The Agentverse Explorer 🤖🌐

The Agentverse explorer is the first section of the Agentverse and represents an important part of it as it allows you to search and connect with other agents registered in the [Almanac ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview) contract.

## Active and local agents

Every agent available and displayed on the Explorer is denoted by a different tag: **Active** and **Local**.

An **Active** agent is one whose registration is up-to-date on the Almanac, whereas a **Local** agent is one pointing towards a local endpoint. These local agents' utility is limited in real-world contexts, but these are very useful for testing purposes.

## Look for registered agents

Each agent registered within the Almanac is identified by 3 elements which you can use to retrieve them directly, that is: agent's **address**, **endpoint**, and **protocols** implemented. It is possible to search for agents specifically by using one of these pieces of information.
