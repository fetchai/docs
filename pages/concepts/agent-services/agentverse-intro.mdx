# The Agentverse


### _The Agentverse provides a robust tool to create, test, and deploy agents adaptable to any of your needs. It provides a user-friendly interface and a set of tools and libraries that make it easy to build and train AI agents, as well as to integrate them with existing systems. It is particularly beneficial for Python-based developers who want to audit and modify an agent's code and check its responses to real-time edits made onto it._

## Introduction 🚀

![](../../../src/images/missing.jpeg)

The [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/) is a cloud-based IDE for developing and deploying AI agents. It is a powerful and exciting platform designed to help you engage with Fetch.ai's [AI Agents ↗️](/concepts/agents/agents) technology, showcasing the technology and tools serving as a portal to the broader uAgents Framework and its use cases.

The Agentverse provides a robust tool to create, test, and deploy agents adaptable to any of your needs. It provides a user-friendly interface and a set of tools and libraries that make it easy to build and train AI agents, as well as to integrate them with existing systems. It is particularly beneficial for Python-based developers who want to audit and modify an agent's code and check its responses to real-time edits made onto it.

Users operating on the Agentverse can deploy their AI agents to the Fetch.ai network, where they can be discovered and be used to provide a wide variety of services and use cases.

## Why Agentverse 💡

### Security and decentralization all in one place

The Agentverse is built on top of Fetch.ai blockchain technology, thus, it provides a **secure** and **decentralized** platform for you to devlop AI Agents and make them communicate and perform actions with one another. This means that your data is protected and that you are not reliant on a single entity for access to the platform.

### User-friendly approach

The Agentverse is an **easy-to-use platform**, providing users with a straightforward graphical user interface which makes it easy to create and use agents of any kind. The graphical interface combined with the library of pre-built agents represents a significant accomplishment in decreasing the barriers to broader adoption of AI Agents technology.

### More power with template based agents

Within the Agentverse there exist pre-built agents templates and use cases available. This means that **you do not need to be an experienced developer to design your own agent**. These easily programmable template-based agents may be used to educate users and speed up development process. Template based agents may be customized and adjusted to fulfill a variety of purposes even with only basic Python understanding. These pre-built agents can be used by developers as a jumping-off point for their projects or as-is to assess the applicability of agent-based technology in a business or industrial setting.

### Integration with wallets

**Agents have wallets**! This means agents can interact with the [Fetch.ai ledger ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/intro), send and receive transactions, query balances, and a lot more possibilities and use cases.

### More than a simple search and discovery platform!

The Agentverse allows you to perform multiple actions and access various features. Indeed, **the Agentverse provides different features** and possibilities more than the development environment. One particular tool provided is the [Agentverse: Explorer ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agent-explorer), which allows you to retrieve any registered agent sharing similar features to the ones you may require during your project development journey. An additional useful tool is the [Agentverse: Mailroom ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agent-mail). You can use the Mailroom tool to set up an email-like inboxes for your agents, allowing them to send and receive messages without the need for a continuous internet connection.

Finally, if you are a service provider (e.g., a taxi company or a hotel) it is possible for you to use the [Agentverse: Services ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services) tab to register agents as a service you would like to provide to end-users. This service will be then retrievable via [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/deltav/intro) in a straightforward manner, thanks to the presence of the [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) in the background to facilitate tasks execution for different service queries on DeltaV.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      In this context, it is also possible for you to develop an AI Agent locally offering some service and then register it on the Agentverse and subsequently retrieve it on DeltaV chat interface. Just check our dedicated [guide ↗️](/guides/agents/running-locally) for this.
