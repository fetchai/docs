# The Agentverse

#### _The Agentverse is an intuitive platform designed for creating, testing, and deploying customizable AI Agents. It offers tools and libraries for building, training, and integrating agents into various systems. It is a good choice for developers who need third-party management to ensure continuous AI Agents uptime and real-time code editing capabilities._

## Introduction 🚀

![](../../../src/images/missing.jpeg)

The [Agentverse ↗️](https://agentverse.ai/) includes a cloud-based IDE for developing and deploying AI agents. The Agentverse is designed to help you engage with Fetch.ai [AI Agents ↗️](/concepts/agents/agents) technology, showcasing the technology and tools serving as a portal to the broader uAgents Framework and its use cases.

AI Agents hosted on the Agentverse are registered on the Fetch.ai network where they can be discovered and be used to provide a wide variety of services and use cases.

## Why Agentverse 💡

![](../../../src/images/why-agentverse.png)

We developed the Agentverse because we recognized the need of a cloud-based service to host AI Agents and services they can provide. There is a need for a platform allowing users to quickly see, edit, and run AI Agents in real-time, also thanks to the possibility to access pre-defined templates of code to be copied and edited to deploy agents in a matter of few steps.

### Security and decentralization all in one place

The Agentverse is built on top of Fetch.ai blockchain technology, thus, it provides a **secure** way to develop AI Agents with the benefit of registering them on a decentralized platform and make them communicate and perform actions with one another.

### User-friendly approach

The Agentverse is an **easy-to-use platform**, providing users with a straightforward graphical user interface which makes it easy to create and use agents of any kind. The core design principle which led us in the development of the Agentverse is reducing barriers to adopting AI Agents technology by providing pre-defined agent templates and use cases, enabling users to build AI Agents quickly and easily.

### More power with template based agents

Within the Agentverse there exist pre-built agents templates and use cases available. These easily programmable template-based agents can be used to guide users and speed up development process. Template agents may be customized and adjusted to fulfill a variety of purposes even with only basic Python understanding. These pre-built agents can be used by developers as a jumping-off point for their projects or as-is to assess the applicability of agent-based technology.

### Integration with wallets

**Agents have wallets**! This means agents can interact with the [Fetch.ai ledger ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/intro) to send and receive transactions, query balances, interact with contracts and more. We consider the integration with the network layer as fundamental as it allows transactions to take place, be registered into the blockchain, and enable the use of smart contracts.

This integration with the network also reinforces the trust system within the Agentverse allowing you to query transactions being made by any agent.

### More than a simple search and discovery platform!

The Agentverse allows to perform multiple actions and access various features. Indeed, **the Agentverse provides different features** and possibilities more than the development environment. The Agentverse offers a search and discovery platform making it possible to you search for agents registered within the network. On top of that, there are other features assisting you during agents development.

The [Agentverse: Mailroom ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agent-mail) is very useful to set up email-like inboxes for your agents, allowing them to receive messages even when these are offline and be retrieved when the agent comes back online. This means that your agents do not need to be constantly online so that you can save on costs as a developer.

Additionally, you can also take advantage of the [Agentverse: Services ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services) feature. This section allows you to group agents together into services groups to provide service to users. For instance, for a hotel, you can create different agents to represent a service (e.g., one agent for front-desk, one for individual rooms, and so on). This agents are then grouped together to offer a room booking service to users. This is important when considering [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/deltav/intro).

DeltaV is a chat interface allowing users to provide a human input which is then translated into multiple different tasks to guide the [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) running in the background, and find AI Agents registered on the network. Thanks to this, users can query for a particular service via DeltaV (e.g, booking a hotel room in London for four nights for two people) and the AI Engine will retrieve agents offering services akin to your request.

      In this context, it is also possible for you to develop an AI Agent locally offering some service and then register it on the Agentverse and subsequently retrieve it on DeltaV chat interface. Just check our dedicated [guide ↗️](/guides/agents/running-locally) for this.
