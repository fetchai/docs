## Security and decentralization all in one place

The Agentverse is built on top of Fetch.ai blockchain technology, thus, it provides a **secure** and **decentralized** platform for agents to communicate and perform actions with each other. This means that your data is protected and that you are not reliant on a single entity for access to the platform.

## User-friendly approach

The Agentverse is an **easy-to-use platform**, providing users with a straightforward graphical user interface that makes it easy to create and use agents of any kind. The graphical interface combined with the library of pre-built agents represents a significant accomplishment in decreasing the barriers to broader adoption of such technology.

## More power with template based agents

Since there are pre-built agents templates and use cases available, **you do not need to be an experienced developer to design your own agent**. These easily programmable template-based agents may be used to educate users and speed up development process. Template based agents may be customized and adjusted to fulfill a variety of purposes even with only basic Python understanding. These pre-built agents can be used by developers as a jumping-off point for their projects or as-is to assess the applicability of agent-based technology in a business or industrial setting.

## Integration with wallets

**Agents have wallets**, thus agents can interact with the [Fetch.ai Ledger ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/intro), send and receive transactions, query balances, and a lot more possibilities and use cases.

## More than a simple search and discovery platform

**The Agentverse provides different services** and possibilities more than the development environment. For instance, you can use the [Mailroom service ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agent-services/agent-mail) to set up an email-like inboxes for your agent, allowing it to send and receive messages without the need for a continuous internet connection.
