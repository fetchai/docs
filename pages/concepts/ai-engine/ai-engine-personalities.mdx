# AI Engine Personalities

## Introduction

This guide explores the **AI Engine personalities** within Fetch.ai's ecosystem. Let's delve into how these personalities enhance user interactions when operating with AI Engine and DeltaV!

## The AI Engine personalities: Powering Fetch.ai's Intelligence

The [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) stands as the heart of Fetch.ai's AI infrastructure, translating human language inputs into actionable [functions ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-functions) for a network of [Agents ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/whats-an-agent) to fulfill them. The AI Engine bridges the gap between users and AI by leveraging powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand complex requests. Here's how it works:

    1. **User input**: the user provide instructions via [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav) which facilitates smooth interaction with the AI Engine.
    2. **Understanding the request**: the AI Engine employs LLMs to analyze the user's request, grasping the intent and identifying the necessary actions.
    3. **Function delegation**: based on the analysis, the AI Engine breaks down the user's request into executable functions.
    4. **Agent coordination**: the AI Engine then orchestrates a network of agents registered on the Fetch Network to execute those functions, ultimately achieving the initial user's objective.

AI Engine personalities are not primarily about user experience or preference. Instead, they represent different versions or iterations of the AI Engine itself, each with its own set of features and capabilities.

The primary reason for introducing different personalities is to manage the development and rollout of new features without disrupting existing functionality. By creating a new personality, developers can experiment with and test new features without affecting the core system. Once these features are stable and mature, they can be integrated into the default personality.

## A Journey through personality types evolution

The following AI Engine personality types are available for users: **Talkative V3** and **NextGeneration**.

    - With version **v0.22**, the NextGeneration personality received significant updates, including support for classical [`UAgentResponse` ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/ai-engine-compatible-agent) type agents, secondary function execution, and interactive UI elements. Notably, Talkative V3 was set to be replaced by NextGeneration in future updates.
    - Version **v0.23** introduced enhanced session-level memory, tracking credit usage, parallel execution in sync worker, and session termination control within the NextGeneration personality.
    - Version **v0.24** deployed **NextGeneration personality as the default**, and thus replacing **Talkative** personality type. This version focuses on significant stability and scalability improvements, supporting millions of agents. This version also introduced immediate agent registration, enhanced message reliability, UI enhancements, privacy compliance, robust timeout and monitoring systems, infrastructure upgrades, and database and deployment improvements.
    - With version **v0.25** the Talkative personality (previously associated with AI Engine V1) started to refer to AI Engine V2 (previously available under the Next Generation personality). To preserve AI Engine V1, a new **Legacy personality** had been introduced, with a scheduled removal date of September 13, 2024. With this release the following features were introduced: _Functions Metadata_ (location settings can now be assigned to functions), _Permission System_ (users can now share private function groups with others via email), _Dialogue Execution Improvements_, _Permission Sharing in Python SDK_ (added functionality to the Python SDK) and _Next Generation Personality (i.e., This was a new iteration of the Next Generation personality, now called Talkative) supports location filtering on functions with location metadata based on objectives_.
    - Version **v0.26** introduces significant enhancements to the AI Engine; The release includes a Workflows Beta, allowing two workflow creation methods: the first via POST requests to `/v1beta1/engine/workflows/SESSION_ID/` with payloads specifying workflow names and descriptions, where `SESSION_ID` is replaced by a session ID from DeltaV; the second allows posting workflow graphs, primarily for the Agentverse editor. To execute workflows, users append `?workflowId=YOUR-WORKFLOW-ID` to the DeltaV homepage URL. Additionally, starting workflows via API now requires POST requests to `/v1beta1/engine/chat/workflow-session/` with the workflow ID in the payload. Additionally, new **Elasticsearch-based Search APIs** were introduced for querying agents and functions, integrated directly into the Agentverse UI. A global **Agent Event Consumer** was added, processing events like agent creation, startup, and interactions to build an indexed database of agents. Furthermore, the **Function Description API** was implemented, generating detailed function descriptions based on an agent’s model and name within the function creation flow. Other technical improvements include **context validation**, **GPT-4o-mini** for enhanced recommendation accuracy within the NextGeneration personality, and **Prometheus metrics** for in-depth performance monitoring and observability of the system's health.

## Exploring the Feature Set of AI Engine Personalities

Here's a breakdown of the key functionalities offered by each personality:

### Talkative

    **Focus**: General conversation and task handling.

    **Key Functionalities**:
        - Enhanced Function recommendations for improved efficiency.
        - Improved context building for natural conversation flow.
        - Agent health checks to ensure optimal performance.

### NextGeneration

    **Focus**: Broad conversational capabilities, advanced functionalities, and scalability.

    **Key Functionalities**:
        - _Supports a variety of [Dialogue ↗️](/guides/agents/advanced/dialogues) protocols_ for flexible user interactions and thus allows for agent interactions with websites and PDFs.
        - Tracks resource usage for transparency.
        - Increased processing speed for faster responses.
        - Manages session endings efficiently.
        - Offers superior stability and scalability for large-scale applications.
        - Completely revamped AI Engine backend for improved performance and future-proofing.
        - Utilizes a more sophisticated LLM for enhanced context understanding.
        - Employs an advanced recommender system to select optimal functions based on your needs.

## Choosing the right personality

We encourage everyone operating on DeltaV to select the **Next Generation** AI Engine personality type. This AI Engine personality stands as a significant personality type offering _enhanced scalability_, _reliability_, and _flexibility_. The major key features include advanced context understanding, improved function recommendations, and most importantly, **the ability to handle multiple dialogue formats**.
