# AI Engine Personalities

## Introduction

This guide explores the **AI Engine personalities** within Fetch.ai's ecosystem. Let's delve into how these personalities enhance user interactions when operating with Ai Engine and DeltaV!

## The AI Engine personalities: Powering Fetch.ai's Intelligence

The [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) stands as the heart of Fetch.ai's AI infrastructure, translating human language inputs into actionable tasks for a network of [Agents ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/whats-an-agent) to fulfill them. The AI Engine bridges the gap between users and AI by leveraging powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand complex requests. Here's how it works:

    1. **User input**: the user provide instructions via [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav) which facilitates smooth interaction with the AI Engine.
    2. **Understanding the request**: the AI Engine employs LLMs to analyze the user's request, grasping the intent and identifying the necessary actions.
    3. **Task delegation**: based on the analysis, the AI Engine breaks down the user's request into executable tasks.
    4. **Agent coordination**: the AI Engine then orchestrates a network of agents registered on the Fetch Network to fulfill those tasks, ultimately achieving the user's objective.

In order to offer a more engaging and user-friendly experience, the AI Engine is being designed to adopt multiple personality types depending on the user's needs. These personalities essentially act as communication styles, influencing how the AI interacts with you. Imagine having a choice between a friendly and informal assistant or a more professional and to-the-point one. By tailoring the AI's character to users' preferences or application needs, developers can design more natural and effective interactions and create more engaging and effective applications.

## A Journey through personality types evolution

The following versions of the AI Engine have introduced different personalities:

    - **v0.17**: introduced **Talkative V3**, focusing on improved task recommendations, context building, and agent health checks.
    - **v0.20**: introduced **NextGeneration** (designed for broader conversational contexts) and **ML Recommender** (in closed beta) for interacting with websites and PDFs.
    - **v0.22**: the NextGeneration personality received significant updates, including support for classical UAgentResponse type agents, secondary function execution, and interactive UI elements. Notably, Talkative V3 was set to be replaced by NextGeneration in future updates.
    - **v0.23**: introduced enhanced session-level memory, tracking credit usage, parallel execution in sync worker, and session termination control within the NextGeneration personality.
    - **v0.24**: this version deployed **NextGeneration personality as the default**, and thus replacing **Talkative V3** personality type. This version focuses on significant stability and scalability improvements, supporting millions of agents. This version also introduced immediate agent registration, enhanced message reliability, UI enhancements, privacy compliance, robust timeout and monitoring systems, infrastructure upgrades, and database and deployment improvements.

## Exploring the Feature Set of AI Engine Personalities

Here's a breakdown of the key functionalities offered by each personality:
