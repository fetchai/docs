# Synergy of agent-based services and AI Engine ecosystem

The AI Engine allows users and developers to connect to a wide range of agent-based services. Once an agent is [registered ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services) the service provided is visible to the AI engine and it can start connecting users and services together. This is made possible thanks to [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/deltav/intro) platform and its functionalities!

This system boasts personalized capabilities thanks to the presence of an internal agent which harmonizes tasks efficiently. Indeed, the AI Engine internally spawns a personal agent (available to chat with via DeltaV) and once you have given it your intent, it asynchronously starts working on your behalf.

At its core lies the immense power of **LLMs (Large Language Models)**, driving the Engine's understanding, coordination, and problem-solving proficiency.

## Enhancing connections

The AI Engine introduces users and developers into a unified ecosystem of agent-based services. Once an agent and its services are registered within the Agentverse ecosystem, these becomes an integral part of the AI Engine's landscape, coordinating dynamic connections between users and services.

## Unveiling the intent's architecture

At the heart of the AI Engine's operation lies a sophisticated architecture comprising two fundamental components: **Objectives** and **Tasks**.

    - **Objectives**: these are the foundation of the AI Engine's efforts, encapsulating the general goals of users in natural language, feeding the purpose and direction of the Engine.

    - **Tasks**: a dynamic sequence of steps that fuels the achievement of the defined objectives. In their complexity, tasks involve resource allocation, temporal considerations, and interdependencies executed by agent-based services.

## Deconstructing tasks

The AI Engine's essence is distilled into two functions:

    1. **Comprehension and planning**: this core process takes the user's objective and transforms it into a meticulously curated series of sub-tasks, each representing an integral step towards the desired final outcome. This coordination can be unfolded autonomously or, in some cases when uncertainty comes into place, with the user's input to validate tasks selection.

    2. **Context building**: the AI Engine is a skillful collector and transformer of information, continuously enriching its understanding. Contextual building is a continuous effort, refining the knowledge landscape happening continuously throughout the session with the AI Engine. In other words, context building is the continuous process in which additional information is collected and/or transformed in order to complete a task.
