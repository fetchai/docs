# AI Engine

## Introduction 🚀


The **AI Engine** is a system that combines [AI Agents ↗️](/concepts/agents/agents) with human readable text inputs to provide a scalable AI infrastructure empowering Large Language Models (LLMs). It is at the core of [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav) and its functionalities. The AI Engine's aim is to parse, comprehend, and link human input to agents by facilitating natural language interactions. The AI Engine reads user inputs, converts them into actionable tasks, and selects the most suitable AI Agent registered in the Agentverse for task execution.

The AI Engine excels at a variety of different tasks. It is able to provide answers to complex queries and act on them to perform different actions, such as creating a booking for a hotel. This is accomplished by its capacity to grasp users' preferences and objectives via **contextual understanding**. The AI Engine examines trends and turns random input into meaningful insights by evaluating previous interactions. When uncertainty comes into play, the AI Engine seeks user feedback to verify its suggestions and recommendations correspond with the user's end goal. This way, the AI Engine actively anticipates and aligns with user needs. We look forward to create an ecosystem where technology becomes an ally in achieving users' objectives.

On top of the Engine's ability to understand different contexts, its **smart routing** ability also covers a fundamental role. This allows the Engine to carry out a careful assessment of available agents registered on the [Almanac ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro), considering their breadth of services and past performance data. This guarantees tasks are assigned to agents having the appropriate level of expertise.

## Next steps

Check our additional resources to better grasp the concepts and functioning of the AI Engine and get yourself started with [DeltaV ↗️](https://deltav.agentverse.ai/) and operations executable on it. Also, head over to the [AI Engine APIs ↗️](/apis#ai-engine-apis) to start building with DeltaV.

      Checkout the [AI Engine package ↗️](https://pypi.org/project/uagents-ai-engine/) to download it and start integrating your AI Agents with this tool!

      If you wish to **register your AI Agent as a service** on the Agentverse, have a look at the following [guide ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services). Also, if you developed your AI Agent **locally** and want to register it to be retrievable on DeltaV, here is a [guide ↗️](/guides/agents/running-locally) for you.
