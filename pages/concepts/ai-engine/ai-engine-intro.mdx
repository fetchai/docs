# AI Engine

## Introduction 🚀

The **AI Engine** is a complex system that combines [AI Agents ↗️](/concepts/agents/agents) services with a robust AI infrastructure powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

The Engine excels at a variety of different tasks, including booking services and provide answers to different queries. This is accomplished thanks to its capacity to grasp users' preferences and objectives via **contextual understanding**. The Engine examines trends and turns random input into meaningful insights by evaluating previous interactions. When uncertainty comes into play, the AI Engine seeks user feedback to verify its suggestions and recommendations correspond with the user's end goal, establishing a collaborative and trust-based environment to ensure optimal implementation. This way, the AI Engine actively anticipates and aligns with user needs, creating an ecosystem where technology becomes an ally in achieving objectives.

On top of the Engine's ability to understand different contexts, its **smart routing** ability also covers a fundamental role. In fact, this feature allows the Engine to carry out a careful assessment of available agents registered within the [Agentverse ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro), considering their breadth of services and past performance data. This guarantees tasks are assigned to agents having the appropriate level of expertise.
