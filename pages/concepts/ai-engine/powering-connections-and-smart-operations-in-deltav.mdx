# Powering connections and smart operations in DeltaV

The AI Engine stands at the core of [DeltaV ↗️](https://deltav.agentverse.ai/login) and its functionalities as it allows users and developers to connect to a wide range of agent-based services. Once an agent is [registered ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services), the service provided is visible to the AI engine and it can start connecting users and services together.

This system is equipped with personalized capabilities facilitated by an internal agent that efficiently executes tasks. An internal agent is created by the AI Engine and made available for communication through the DeltaV UI. The AI Engine interprets the textual human input provided to the agent and starts working asynchronously on your behalf as soon as it receives your intent. This customized method makes use of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are essential for improving the comprehension, coordination, and problem-solving abilities of the AI Engine.

## Establishing connections

The AI Engine introduces users and developers into a unified ecosystem of agent-based services. Once an agent and its services are registered within the [Agentverse ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro) and also the [Almanac ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview), these becomes an integral part of the AI Engine's landscape, coordinating dynamic connections between users and services. For example, when you ask to DeltaV agent what the weather will be like tomorrow at your location, it connects to a registered agent and gets the latitude and longitude for where you are right now. The weather prediction for that particular day is then retrieved by this agent through a connection to another registered agent that specializes in weather-related services.

## Intent's architecture

At the heart of the AI Engine's operation lies a sophisticated architecture comprising two fundamental components: **Objectives** and **Tasks**.

    - **Objectives** are the encapsulation of the general goals of the user provided in natural language through DeltaV chat.

    - **Tasks** form a dynamic sequence of steps that drive the accomplishment of these defined objectives. Tasks involve intricate processes, including resource allocation and interdependencies managed by agent-based services.

## Deconstructing tasks: context building and smart routing

Finding new information is a key focus of the AI Engine to enhance the user journey significantly. This is crucial for the execution of services, such reserving a hotel room for your holiday in a specified city. In a setting where reservations are centralized, this appears like a simple operation. But to make that booking successful, the AI Engine must be able to comprehend the user's input and objectives and communicate with several agents. It is at this stage that the AI Engine **comprehension and planning** ability is very important: the user's goal is broken down into a number of smaller tasks and sub-tasks, each representing an integral step towards the desired final outcome. This coordination can be carried out automatically, or in specific situations when the AI Engine is unsure, it can need user input to confirm task selection.

**Context building** plays a crucial role allowing the AI Engine to continuously improve its comprehension by transforming data. Contextual building is the ongoing process within the AI Engine involving the constantly improvement of the knowledge base during the AI Engine session. In other words, context building is the continuous act of gathering and/or transforming new knowledge to complete a task.

The final step of the AI Engine's operations is **smart routing**, that is the ongoing process within the AI Engine making it aware of all the registered AI Agents and the tasks they best fit. This process takes into account the context and past performance history of these agent to guide the AI Engine's decision-making process. This way, The AI Engine chooses the most suitable agent considering agents' services and their historical performance metrics. **Trust** becomes a key factor, with agents having a track record of dependable behavior given preference. Smart routing not only assures tasks completion, but also creates a sense of dependability and efficiency in the cooperation.
