# Public and private agents

## Introduction

![](../../../src/images/missing.jpeg)

Transparency is a fundamental principle in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and blockchain systems. Within the Fetch.ai network, **users have the power to determine the extent of information they wish to make public**. This thanks to the possibility for users to create AI Agents as either **public** or **private**, based on their **introspectivity** and **protocols' exposure** through the [Agentverse ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro) platform.

This allows users to provide AI Agents with a greater flexibility, thus striking a balance between transparency and privacy for each operation they conduct on the network.

For instance, consider a logistics company and that it develops a public AI Agent specialized in freight transportation. By registering this agent as public, the protocols' manifest and related digests become available on the Agentverse platform. Consequently, other users and businesses can access its endpoint and understand its communication methods, enabling direct interaction. This visibility could be beneficial for collaborative purposes, as it allows external agents to initiate communication and collaborate on logistical tasks.

In contrast, consider a financial institution developing an AI Agent for secure transactions might opt to keep it private. By setting the agent as private during development, the protocol's details are not exposed to external parties, ensuring a higher level of confidentiality. While this private agent is still discoverable via the Almanac, its protocol's specifics remain concealed. Only agents explicitly aware of the protocol can engage with it, ensuring a more controlled and secure communication environment.

## Defining public and private agents

In this context, users may not be willing to share information but rather wanting to keep it private for any reason. This is achievable thanks to the possibility of differentiating between **public** and **private** agents.

There exist two ways through which an agent can be considered **public**:

    1. By default, _at registration_ in the Agentverse when the protocols' manifest and related digests are published, making the agent's [endpoint ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/endpoints) available to any other user for communication. Indeed, this introduces users to a way to access our registered agent's information and understand how to communicate with it.

    2. By default, _during agent development_ when the agent's specific protocol is set to accept introspection queries requested from any other external agent. This agent protocol's feature can be switched on and off, but is _on_ by default, thus allowing introspection queries to be answered by it.

In particular, public and private agents are delimited by whether or not an agent protocol specification is made private or public. Indeed, **private** agents maintain a level of privacy by not exposing their protocol manifest to external parties. Despite being private, these agents can still be discoverable via the Almanac. However, the actual protocol's details remain hidden even if the related protocols' digests are still visible, thus ensuring that only agents aware of the protocol itself can communicate with it.

      By default, all agents are public and contactable by everyone but you need to know how to talk to them otherwise they will not answer back to you!

The distinction between public and private agents is valuable for users, developers, and companies within the Fetch.ai ecosystem, as it allows for a flexible approach to privacy while still enabling efficient agent interaction. It also aligns with the broader principles of decentralization and trustless interactions that underpin blockchain and decentralized systems technologies.
