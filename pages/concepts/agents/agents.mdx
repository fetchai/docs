# AI Agents - uAgents Framework

## Introduction üöÄ

The **uAgents Framework** is a lightweight package designed to facilitate the development of decentralized **AI Agents**.

These agents are programs able to interact autonomously with other agents in a decentralized environment. AI agents have the capability to operate in a decentralized manner, yet their decentralization remains optional and contingent on individual preferences or needs.

These agents represent the foundational building block allowing developers to access the tools and resources made available through the uAgents Framework and making it possible to create and participate in intelligent and self-governing systems that can operate across different fields in the real world.

## Why AI Agents üí°

With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI related products, autonomous intelligent agents represent the bridge allowing to connect to suche AI Models and tools to revolutionize the approach we have to problem-solving, decision-making, and collaborative behaviors. Intelligent agents hold immense potential to transform our understanding of complex systems. For instance, AI agents leveraging the uAgents Framework could be used within supply chain management, to optimize processes across various stages. They could be used to forecast demand, manage inventory, optimize logistics, oversee supplier relations, ensure quality control, and mitigate risks across all processes. This way, agents would enhance efficiency, reduce costs, improve accuracy, and provide real-time visibility, revolutionizing supply chain operations.

Another example comes from the financial sector. In this case, AI agents would play a crucial role in automating trading processes, risk assessment, fraud detection, and customer service. These could adopt predictive analytics to make investment decisions, analyze market trends in real-time, assess risks associated with loans or investments, and personalize financial advice for clients based on their profiles and market conditions. They would also help in detecting fraudulent activities by continuously monitoring transactions and patterns, thus enhancing security measures. AI agents in finance could streamline operations, provide valuable insights, and improve decision-making for both financial institutions and individual investors.

In this context, Fetch.ai introduces the **uAgents Framework**. This open-source framework is designed to empower developers with the tools to build intelligent autonomous agents and take part into the decentralized network of multiple agents to face the complexities of the modern world. AI agents exclusively undertake tasks defined by developers, and these tasks can be precisely outlined by coding customizable behaviors tailored for highly specific use cases and scenarios.

The notion of AI Agents symbolizes decentralized and self-governing systems that break free from traditional constraints.
AI Agents offer a gateway to a future where intelligent agents empowered by the Fetch network and the [AI Engine ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) can communicate, negotiate, and collaborate to streamline complex tasks, solve intricate problems, and enhance decision-making processes across various domains.

### Reasons to build with AI Agents

The uAgents Framework opens up to developers at all levels, offering an approachable entry point for beginners while also providing an expansive landscape for seasoned developers. Its intuitive learning curve welcomes newcomers into the journey of creating intelligent and autonomous AI Agents within the Python environment, while also offering rich customization options that cater to the expertise of more advanced developers.

Central to the capabilities of AI Agents, we find the [AI Engine ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) and [DeltaV ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/deltav/intro). The AI Engine acts as the core, matching agents registered on the [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro) with tasks suitable for their capabilities. These agents can then be discovered and engaged on DeltaV, where they are harnessed to execute an array of diverse tasks and functionalities. These includes different tasks ranging from [coin toss ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss) and [dice roll ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll) related tasks to [booking flights and hotels ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/deltav/book-service-with-deltav) on your behalf and more.

**Connectivity** is also an important feature of the Framework. It opens up possibilities where agents, regardless of their level of complexity or specialization, can straightforwardly integrate into a rapidly expanding network of agents thanks to the [Almanac ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview). Upon registration on the Almanac, AI Agents register and get onboard of the Fetch network fostering effortless collaboration and interaction among a diverse array of participants and agents.

**Security** remains a top priority, with the Framework implementing robust measures to protect the integrity of agents' messages and wallets. Through cryptographic safeguards measures, the Framework ensures the secure identity and asset management of agents, promoting peace of mind amidst their interactions and operations.

Moreover, the **platform and language independence** offered by the Framework provides an unparalleled level of flexibility. Initially developed using Python, AI Agents leverage the [Exchange Protocol ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/exchange-protocol)'s standard data types, enabling transcendence across various programming languages and platforms. This adaptability paves the way for future expansions into different programming languages, enriching the accessibility and reach of agents across diverse ecosystems.
