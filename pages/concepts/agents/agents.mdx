# AI Agents - uAgents Framework

## Introduction üöÄ

The **uAgents Framework** is a lightweight package designed to facilitate the development of decentralized **AI Agents**.

These agents are programs able to interact autonomously with other agents in a decentralized environment. AI agents can operate in a decentralized manner, yet their decentralization remains optional and contingent on individual preferences or needs.

These agents are the fundamental building blocks that enable developers to gain access to the tools and resources made available by the uAgents Framework, allowing them to create and participate in intelligent and self-governing systems that can operate across multiple fields in the real world.

## Why AI Agents üí°

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-related products have made autonomous intelligent agents the link between these models and tools. These revolutionize how we solve problems, make decisions, and collaborate with one another. Intelligent agents have the power to alter how we see complicated systems fundamentally. For example, supply chain management could apply AI Agents utilizing the uAgents Framework to improve operations at different stages. Demand forecasting, inventory control, logistics optimization, supplier relations supervision, quality control, and risk mitigation in all operations can be accomplished with their help. Agents could transform supply chain operations by increasing efficiency, lowering costs, improving accuracy, and providing real-time visibility.

The finance industry provides another example. In this scenario, the automation of trading operations, risk evaluation, fraud detection, and customer support would be greatly aided by AI Agents. They may use predictive analytics to perform real-time market trend analysis, risk assessments for loans and investments, and customized financial advice for customers based on their profiles and the state of the market. By continuously observing transactions and patterns, they could also help in the detection of fraudulent operations, hence strengthening security measures. AI agents in the financial sector have the potential to simplify processes, offer insightful information, and enhance decision-making for both financial organizations and individual investors.

In this context, Fetch.ai introduces the **uAgents Framework**. With the help of this open-source framework, developers are able to create intelligent autonomous agents and join a decentralized network of many agents to effectively tackle the challenges posed by the modern world. AI Agents only do tasks that developers specify, and these tasks can be accurately described by coding customizable behaviors for specific use cases and scenarios.

The concept of AI Agents reflects autonomous, decentralized systems that overcome conventional limitations.
AI Agents offer a gateway to a future where intelligent agents empowered by the Fetch network and the [AI Engine ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) can communicate, negotiate, and collaborate to streamline complex tasks, solve intricate problems, and enhance decision-making processes across various domains.

### Reasons to build with AI Agents

The uAgents Framework is available to developers of all skill levels, giving beginners a manageable starting point and experienced developers a wide range of options. Its easy learning curve makes it accessible to beginners who want to create intelligent, self-governing AI Agents in the Python environment, while simultaneously providing significant customization choices for more experienced developers.

Central to the capabilities of AI Agents, we find the [AI Engine ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) and [DeltaV ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/deltav/intro). The AI Engine acts as the core, matching agents registered on the [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro) with tasks suitable for their capabilities. These agents can then be discovered and engaged on DeltaV, where they are harnessed to execute an array of diverse tasks and functionalities. These range from [coin toss ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss) and [dice roll ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll) related tasks to [booking flights and hotels ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/deltav/book-service-with-deltav) on your behalf and more.

**Connectivity** is also an important feature of the uAgents Framework. It opens up possibilities where agents, regardless of their level of complexity or specialization, can straightforwardly integrate into a rapidly expanding network of agents thanks to the [Almanac ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview). Upon registration on the Almanac, AI Agents register and get on board the Fetch network fostering effortless collaboration and interaction among a diverse array of participants and agents.

**Security** remains a top priority with the uAgents Framework implementing robust measures to protect the integrity of agents' messages and wallets. Through cryptographic safeguards measures, the Framework ensures the secure identity and asset management of agents, promoting peace of mind amidst their interactions and operations.

Moreover, the uAgents Framework provides an unparalleled level of flexibility due to its **platform and language independence**. Initially developed using Python, AI Agents leverage the [Exchange Protocol ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/exchange-protocol)'s standard data types,making them cross-platform and cross-programming language compatible. This flexibility opens the door for upcoming extensions into more programming languages, enhancing the agents' reach and accessibility within many ecosystems.
