# AI Agents - uAgents Framework

## Introduction 🚀

The **uAgents Framework** is a lightweight package designed to facilitate the development of decentralized **AI Agents**.

AI Agents are programs that can interact autonomously with other agents in a decentralized environment. These agents can operate in a decentralized manner, but their decentralization remains optional and dependent on individual preferences or needs.

These agents are the basic building blocks that allow developers to gain access to the tools and resources provided by the uAgents Framework, enabling them to create and participate in intelligent and self-managed systems that can be used in various real-world domains.

## Why AI Agents 💡

With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-related products, autonomous intelligent agents have become the link between these models and tools. They are revolutionizing the way we solve problems, make decisions and collaborate with each other. Intelligent agents can fundamentally change the way we see complicated systems. For example, supply chain management could deploy AI Agents using the uAgents Framework to improve operations at various stages. Demand forecasting, inventory control, logistics optimization, supplier relationships monitoring, quality control and risk mitigation in all areas can be done with their help. Agents could transform supply chain operations by increasing efficiency, reducing costs, improving accuracy and providing real-time visibility.

The financial industry is another example. In this scenario, the automation of trading transactions, risk assessment, fraud detection and customer support would be greatly aided by AI Agents. They can use predictive analytics to perform real-time market trend analysis, perform risk assessments for loans and investments, and create customized financial advice for clients based on their profiles and the state of the market. By continuously monitoring transactions and patterns, they could also help to detect fraud, strengthening security measures. AI agents in the financial sector have the potential to simplify processes, provide insightful information and improve decision-making for both financial companies and individual investors.

In this context, Fetch.ai introduces the **uAgents Framework**. Using this open-source framework, developers are able to create intelligent, autonomous agents and join a decentralized network of many agents to effectively tackle the challenges of the modern world. AI Agents only perform tasks specified by the developers, and these tasks can be precisely described by coding customizable behavior for specific use cases and scenarios.

The concept of AI Agents stands for autonomous, decentralized systems that overcome conventional limitations.
AI Agents provide a gateway to a future where intelligent agents, empowered by the Fetch network and the [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro), can communicate, negotiate and collaborate to streamline complex tasks, solve complicated problems and improve decision-making processes in various fields.

### Reasons to build with AI Agents

The uAgents Framework is available to developers of all skill levels and offers beginners a manageable starting point and experienced developers a wide range of options. Its simple learning curve makes it accessible to beginners who want to create intelligent, self-managed AI Agents in the Python environment, while providing extensive customization options for more experienced developers.

At the centre of AI agent capabilities are the [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro) and [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/deltav/intro). The AI engine acts as a core that matches agents registered in the [Agentverse ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro) with tasks that match their skills. These agents can then be discovered and deployed on DeltaV, where they can perform a range of different tasks and functions. These range from [coin-tossing ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-coin-toss) and [dice-rolling ↗️](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-dice-roll) to [booking flights and hotels ↗️](/guides/deltav/book-service-with-deltav) on your behalf and more.

**Connectivity** is also an important feature of the uAgents Framework. It opens up possibilities where agents, regardless of their complexity or specialization, can easily integrate into a rapidly growing network of agents thanks to the [Almanac ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview). Once registered in the Almanac, AI Agents are registered and included in the Fetch network, promoting effortless collaboration and interaction between a large number of participants and agents.

**The uAgents Framework implements robust measures to protect the integrity of agents' messages and wallets. Through cryptographic safeguards, the Framework ensures the secure identity and asset management of agents, providing peace of mind in their interactions and operations.

In addition, the uAgents Framework offers an unparalleled level of flexibility thanks to its **platform and language independence**. Originally developed in Python, AI Agents use the standard data types of the [exchange protocol ↗️](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/exchange-protocol), making them compatible across platforms and programming languages. This flexibility opens the door for future extensions into other programming languages, improving the reach and accessibility of agents in many ecosystems.
