# AI Agents - uAgents Framework

## Introduction üöÄ

The **uAgents Framework** is a lightweight package designed to facilitate the development of decentralized **AI Agents**.

These agents are programs able to interact autonomously with other agents in a decentralized environment. These agents provides developers with the tools and resources to create intelligent and self-governing systems that can operate across different fields in the real world.

## Why AI Agents üí°

Within the world of decentralized technology, the rise of autonomous intelligent agents has revolutionized the approach we have to problem-solving, decision-making, and collaborative behaviors. Intelligent agents hold immense potential to transform our understanding of complex systems.

Fetch.ai introduces the **uAgents Framework** designed to empower developers with the tools to build intelligent, autonomous agents able to face the complexities of the modern world.

At the core of this vision lies the concept of **AI Agents**, a type of decentralized, autonomous programs that transcend traditional boundaries, unlocking a realm of possibilities yet unexplored. AI Agents offer a gateway to a future where intelligent agents communicate, negotiate, and collaborate in a straightforward and trustless fashion, harnessing the power of decentralized networks. As pioneers, we are strongly driven by our passion for innovation and the potential of AI Agents to reshape the structure of the society as we know.

The days of centralized decision-making have come to an end! Now, autonomous agents have the chance of taking charge, empowered by the Framework to manifest unique, customizable behaviors that suit the most specific use cases. The journey begins with a few lines of code, where creativity meets functionality, and the potential to build intelligent agents that adapt, learn, and engage with the world becomes a tangible reality.

### Reasons to build with AI Agents

    - **Easiness to learn**: the uAgents Framework offers a user-friendly learning curve, allowing developers to quickly grasp the concepts and get started with building intelligent and autonomous AI Agents. Check out our guide to [install ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/installing-uagent) the [Python ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/) package and [create your first agent ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/create-a-uagent) in just a few steps.

    - **Customizability**: with AI Agents you have the freedom to unleash your creativity and build any type of agent you can imagine. The Framework provides extensive customization options, empowering you to tailor the behavior, decision-making processes, and interactions of your agents according to your specific use cases.

    - **Connectedness**: when an agent starts up, it becomes part of the rapidly expanding network of agents. By registering on the [Almanac ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview), which is a smart contract developed and deployed on the Fetch.ai blockchain, your AI Agents instantaneously join this dynamic ecosystem of agents, enabling effortless collaboration and interaction with other participants and agents.

    - **Security**: this is a top priority in every decentralized environment, and the Framework ensures the protection of your agents' messages and wallets. The identities and assets associated with agents are safeguarded through cryptographic measures, providing peace of mind and maintaining the integrity of your agents' interactions and transactions.

    - **Platform and language independency**: while initially launched as a Python library, the [Exchange Protocol ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/exchange-protocol) used by AI Agents is defined in terms of standard data types. This inherent flexibility allows the Framework to transcend any specific platform or programming language. As a lightweight and adaptable Framework, expect the emergence of packages and implementations in other programming languages to further expand the reach and accessibility of agents in the near future!

### Get started with AI Agents development!

Let's get started by checking out the [GitHub repository ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/fetchai/uAgents) to improve your understanding on the uAgents Framework and related concepts. You can also checkout our [AI Agents guides ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides#ai-agents) to start familiarize with the code side of agents creation, and the [uAgents Framework references ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/references#uagents-framework) for important resources needed during AI Agents development.
