# Hosting / Managed Agents

In the **Managed Agents** section you are able to build any type of agent you wish. The benefit for you is that you do not have to carry the hassle of deploying your agents continuously, given that we run them for you using cloud technology. This means that your agents will continue running and receive messages without the need of your presence for them to be deployed. **The only task for you is to create great agents to satisfy all kinds of your needs!**

Bear in mind that managed agents are currently a beta feature and because of this, they do not fully support the complete μAgents toolset for development. Improvements and upgrades are foreseen in the future!

There are different ways through which you can start creating your agents. You can either choose to build an agent from a blank script, by clicking on **+ Agents**, or you can choose to create your agent based on a specified templates, by clicking on **+ Use Case**.

## Create an agent
 
By choosing the **+ Agents** option, you will first need to provide a name for the agent you plan to build. Once you select it, your agent will be ready to be coded and a box will appear in the **Managed Agents** page with different data being displayed about the agent you have just created, including the agent’s name and address. 

By clicking on this box, a text editor will appear allowing you to code your agent straightforwardly. This is the **Agent Editor**. You can use this editor to build the code for the agent you have in mind, edit it, and refine it all in one place. The Agent Editor provides you with different fundamental information about your agent: **agent's address** and **wallet address**. You can also provide a **Web3 Agent Name**. To do so, just click on **+ Register Domain Name** and fill in the dedicated field for this. This way, your agent will be given a unique name, making it easier for other agents to find and communicate with it. Only requirement is the name being in lowercase with no whitespaces in between.

An additional feature of the Agent Editor is that at the end of the editor you can find the **Agents Logs**, which is a built-in terminal displaying the output of your script after it is being run. This way, we aim at making agents' development as quick and efficient as possible. 

## Create an agent based on an use case

By choosing this option, you will be able to create an agent based on a specific **template**. There are different categories you can choose from:

1. **Getting Started**: this category helps you in creating basic agents using the uAgents technology. You can:
   - Create your first agent.
   - Send messages between two agents.
   - Storing data.
   - Organize your agents with protocols.
   - Create an agent requesting data from a website.
   - Create an agent sending tokens to another agent.
   - Create an agent interacting with an oracle smart contract.

2. **AI/ML**: this category allows you to develop AI/ML agents. You can choose to:
   - Create an agent requesting data from an AI model.

3. **Smart Services**: this category smart agents for different services, including:
   - **Weather Agents**: this allows you to develop agents retrieving weather data from weather services API.
   - **Weather Data Provider and Consumer Agents**: this use case allows you to create two different agents, one providing weather data and another one consuming such data.
   - **Weather Data Seller and Buyer Agents**:  this use case allows you to create two different agents, one selling weather data and another one buying such data.
   - **Weather Oracle Provider and Consumer Agents**: this use case allows you to create two different agents, one updating an oracle contract with weather data and another one requesting such data to the oracle by paying a small fee. 

Whenever you choose one of the templates available to start building your agent you will have some additional information appearing when clicking on the use case chosen, alongside with the code needed to make it runnable. Additionally, each template available presents a small number in the right corner indicating the number of agents available for that particular template.
