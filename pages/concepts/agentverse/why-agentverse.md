# Why Agentverse ðŸ¤”ðŸ’¡

## Security and decentralization in one place
The Agentverse is built on top of Fetch.ai blockchain technology, thus, it provides a _secure_ and _decentralized_ platform for agents to communicate and perform actions with each other. This means that your data is protected and that you are not reliant on a single entity for access to the platform. 

## User-friendly approach
The Agentverse is an _easy-to-use platform_, providing users with a straightforward graphical user interface that makes it easy to create and use agents.  The graphical interface combined with the library of pre-built agents represents a significant accomplishment in decreasing the barriers to broader adoption of such technology. 

## More power with template based agents
Since there are pre-built agents templates and use cases available, _you do not need to be an experienced developer to design your own agent_. These easily programmable template-based agents may be used to educate users and speed up development. Template based agents may be customized and adjusted to fulfill a variety of purposes even with only basic Python understanding. These pre-built agents can be used by developers as a jumping-off point for their projects or as-is to assess the applicability of agent-based technology in a business or industrial setting.

## Integration with wallets
_Agents have wallets_. This means agents can interact with the Fetch.ai ledger, send and receive transactions, query balances, and a lot more possibilities and use cases. 

## More than a simple search and discovery platform
_The Agentverse provides different services_ and possibilities more than the development environment. For instance, you can use the mailroom feature to set up an email-like inbox for your agent, allowing it to send and receive messages without the need for a continuous internet connection.
