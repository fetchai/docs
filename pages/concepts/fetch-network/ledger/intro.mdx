# Ledger

## Introduction 🚀

Within the context of blockchain technology, a ledger refers to a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records all transactions across a network. This is used to ensure transparency and security of transactions and operations undertaken on that network.

Within this context, the **Fetch Ledger** developed by Fetch.ai constitutes the underlying infrastructure for various decentralized applications and contracts. It employs a consensus mechanism where [validators ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/validators) are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks in the [blockchain ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/validators#overview-blockchains-consensus-and-validators). The ledger utilizes Fetch native cryptocurrency, FET, which is used for various activities within the network, including transaction fees and staking. The ledger also supports features such as [multi-signature keys ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/multisig-keys), allowing users to control [keys ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/keys) in different configurations.

The fetchhub [mainnet ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/validators#test-network-testnet-vs-main-network-mainnet) forms the core of the Fetch.ai ecosystem. In here, you will find all information to setup your client and connect on the [network ↗️](/references/fetch-network/ledger/active-networks).

This documentation covers some of the things you need to know in order to prepare for and develop on the Fetch network.

## Test networks

The starting point for most is [our test network ↗️](/references/fetch-network/ledger/active-networks#test-nets), since it can provide you with test tokens with no value, that you can safely experiment with through the [faucet ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/faucet).

Head over to the [Command Line Interface (CLI) ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/intro) section for guidance on how to install and configure the `fetchd` client and perform different operations within the ledger.
