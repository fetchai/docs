# Ledger

## Introduction 🚀

The fetchhub mainnet forms the core of the Fetch.ai ecosystem. In these pages, you will find all information to setup your client and connect on the [network ↗️](/concepts/ledger/active-networks) and [CLI introduction ↗️](/guides/ledger/cli/intro) pages.

This documentation covers some of the things you need to know in order to prepare for and develop on this network.

## Test networks

The starting point for most will be [our test network ↗️](/concepts/ledger/active-networks#test-nets), since it can provide you with test tokens with no value, that you can safely experiment with.

Head over the [Command Line client ↗️](/guides/ledger/cli/intro) section for guidance on how to install and configure the `fetchd` client.
