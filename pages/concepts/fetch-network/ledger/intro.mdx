# Ledger

## Introduction 🚀

A **ledger** refers to a decentralized and distributed digital book that records all transactions across a network. This is used to ensure transparency and security of transactions and operations undertaken on that network.

Within this context, the **Fetch Ledger** developed by Fetch.ai constitutes the underlying infrastructure for various decentralized applications and contracts. It employs a consensus mechanism where [validators ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/validators) are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks in the [blockchain ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/validators#overview-blockchains-consensus-and-validators). The ledger utilizes Fetch native cryptocurrency, FET, which is used for various activities within the network, including transaction fees and staking. The ledger also supports features such as [multi-signature keys ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/multisig-keys), allowing users to control [keys ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/keys) in different configurations.

The fetchhub [mainnet ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/validators#test-network-testnet-vs-main-network-mainnet) forms the core of the Fetch.ai ecosystem. In here, you will find all information to setup your client and connect on the network.

      Head over to our [guides ↗️](/guides) section and get yourself started with the ledger [installation ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/installation) and different executable operations. Also, you can checkout our [GitHub repository ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/fetchd) to further enhance your understanding of these topics.

      You can also visit the [references ↗️](/references) section for further information on ledger related topics, including [active networks ↗️](/references/fetch-network/ledger/active-networks) specifications, [ledger versions ↗️](/references/fetch-network/ledger/versions), and the [Command Line Interface (CLI) ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/intro) section for guidance on how to install and configure the `fetchd` client and perform different operations within the ledger using the CLI.

## Test networks

The starting point for most users is [the test network ↗️](/references/fetch-network/ledger/active-networks#test-nets). Our test network (testnet) provides you with test tokens with no value, that you can safely experiment with through the [faucet ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/faucet).
