# Ledger

## Introduction 🚀

The Fetch Ledger is the blockchain network developed by Fetch.ai and which constitutes the underlying infrastructure for various decentralized applications and contracts. It employs a consensus mechanism where [validators ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/validators) are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks in the blockchain. The ledger utilizes Fetch native cryptocurrency, FET, which is used for various activities within the network, including transaction fees and staking. The ledger also supports features like [multi-signature keys ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/multisig-keys), allowing users to control [keys ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/keys) in different configurations.

The fetchhub mainnet forms the core of the Fetch.ai ecosystem. In these pages, you will find all information to setup your client and connect on the [network ↗️](/references/fetch-network/ledger/active-networks).

This documentation covers some of the things you need to know in order to prepare for and develop on the Fetch network.

## Test networks

The starting point for most is [our test network ↗️](/references/fetch-network/ledger/active-networks#test-nets), since it can provide you with test tokens with no value, that you can safely experiment with through the [faucet ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/faucet).

Head over to the [Command Line Interface (CLI) client ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/intro) section for guidance on how to install and configure the `fetchd` client and perform different operations within the ledger.
