# Fetch Ledger

## Introduction

A **ledger** refers to a decentralized and distributed digital book that records all transactions across a network. This is used to ensure transparency and security of transactions and operations undertaken on that network.

Within this context, the **Fetch Ledger** developed by Fetch.ai constitutes the underlying infrastructure for various decentralized applications and contracts. It employs a consensus mechanism where [validators ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/validators) are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks in the [blockchain ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/validators#overview-blockchains-consensus-and-validators). The ledger utilizes Fetch native cryptocurrency, FET, which is used for various activities within the network, including transaction fees and staking. The ledger also supports features such as [multi-signature keys ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/multisig-keys), allowing users to control [keys ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/keys) in different configurations.

The fetchhub [mainnet ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/validators#test-network-testnet-vs-main-network-mainnet) forms the core of the ASI ecosystem. In here, you will find all information to setup your client and connect on the network.

      Head over to our [guides ↗️](/guides) section and get yourself started with the ledger [installation ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/installation) and different executable operations. Also, you can checkout our [GitHub repository ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/fetchd) to further enhance your understanding of these topics.

      You can also visit the [references ↗️](/references) section for further information on ledger related topics, including [active networks ↗️](/references/ledger/active-networks) specifications, [ledger versions ↗️](/references/ledger/versions), and the [Command Line Interface (CLI) ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/cli/intro) section for guidance on how to install and configure the `fetchd` client and perform different operations within the ledger using the CLI.

This documentation covers the things you need to know in order to prepare yourself and start developing on the ASI network.

## Test networks

The starting point for most users is [the test network ↗️](/references/ledger/active-networks#test-nets). Our test network (testnet) provides you with test tokens with no value, that you can safely experiment with through the [faucet ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/ledger/faucet).
