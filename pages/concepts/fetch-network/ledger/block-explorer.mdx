# Block explorer üîé

Each of the available [networks ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/ledger/active-networks) has a dedicated block explorer website associated with it. This is a useful tool for monitoring network activity.

## Logging in with the ledger nano

Return to the block explorer landing page and click on the key button in the top right corner. Here, you will be prompted to _Sign in With Ledger_. **You must accept this request on your ledger nano device**. After completing this process, the key button will be replaced by a person icon with a link to your personal address page, which keeps track of the activity that you have performed on the test-net.

## Getting testnet tokens from the faucet

For networks that support it, you can obtain tokens for your account by copying the address and pasting it into the token faucet. Then, return to the main page, press the **Get Funds** button and paste your address in the pop-up. Afterwards, you can return to your address page (via the person icon) and should observe that you have been allocated **1 TESTFET**.

## Transferring tokens to another address

After receiving tokens, you can send these to another address using the purple **Transfer** button on your address page. This will trigger a pop-up that prompts you to specify the destination address and the amount you wish to transfer. After filling in this information, you will be asked to sign the transaction using your ledger nano. The confirmation that the transaction has been broadcast gives two links that can be used to check that the transaction has been executed on the blockchain using either the transaction hash or your account page.

## Delegating stake to a validator

You can delegate your test-net tokens to a validator who is operating the network by clicking on the **Validators** tab, and selecting one of the validators that you wish to delegate stake towards. In the **Voting Power** panel there is an option to **DELEGATE** tokens. Pressing this button will trigger a pop-up that prompts you to select a delegation amount and then sign the transaction with your Ledger Nano device.

Upon delegating tokens, buttons labeled **REDELEGATE** and **UNDELEGATE** will appear. Delegating tokens to a validator rewards you for helping to secure the network. If you wish to delegate to a different validator, you can do so through a **REDELEGATE** transaction. You can retrieve any bonded tokens to your address by submitting an **UNDELEGATE** request, which will return the tokens after a 21-day waiting period. The rewards you receive from delegating tokens to a validator are displayed on your account page and can be sent to your address through a **WITHDRAW** transaction.
