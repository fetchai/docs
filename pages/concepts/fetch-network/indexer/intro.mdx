# Indexer / Ledger SubQuery

##  Introduction 🚀

The **ledger-subquery** is a [SubQuery-based ↗️](https://www.subquery.network/) indexer for the Fetch ledger. This indexer provides a [Graphql ↗️](https://www.subquery.network/) API for querying tracked entities.

For a list of tracked entities, see the [schema.graphql file ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/ledger-subquery/blob/main/schema.graphql).

To learn more about how to [run ↗️](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html) or [change this SubQuery Project ↗️](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/cosmos.html) to get your own custom GraphQL API for your app, [visit the SubQuery Academy ↗️](https://academy.subquery.network/) for documentation.

Further information on the indexer can be found in the [References ↗️](/references) page of our website.
