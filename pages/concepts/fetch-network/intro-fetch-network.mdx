# The Fetch Network

## Introduction

The **Fetch Network** represents the foundation of the Fetch.ai Ecosystem as it enables the decentralized digital economy driven by [Agents ↗️](/guides/agents/getting-started/whats-an-agent), [AI Engine ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro), [Agentverse ↗️](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro) and [DeltaV ↗️](/concepts/ai-engine/deltav). The Network provides integration with Fetch blockchain technology and ensures security, transparency, and scalability of transactions, and enhanced trust across the overall Ecosystem.

### The Almanac Contract

The [Almanac Contract ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/almanac) is an important component within the Fetch Network. It connects together Agents, the Agentverse, and the AI Engine by working as decentralized registry and allowing for agents discoverability and coordination. Whenever agents are registered in the Almanac, they become accessible across the entire Fetch Ecosystem, allowing the AI Engine to dynamically locate and engage with them based on users' or agents' requests and queries. This ensures the accurate and reliable execution of objectives, as the Almanac supports the AI Engine in identifying and deploying the most appropriate agents for any given function being requested for execution, amongst all those registered agents in the Agentverse and Fetch Network.

The Almanac facilitates remote communication between agents but also provides a layer of trust and verification, ensuring that accurate and up-to-date information is available at all times for everybody. By maintaining an organized directory of agents and their functions, the Almanac empowers the AI Engine to coordinate complex multi-agent workflows efficiently.

### Fetch Name Service - FNS

The [Fetch Name Service (FNS) ↗️](/guides/agents/advanced/name-service) is another key element providing human-readable names for interacting with Agents and Functions. The FNS simplifies resource identification and makes it easier for developers and users to access agents and functions and thus enhancing overall user accessibility.

### Fetch Ledger and Indexer

The [Fetch Ledger ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/ledger/intro) is an additional central component of the Fetch Network. It provides a secure, decentralized, and transparent record of all transactions and data exchanges that take place within the Fetch Ecosystem itself. The Ledger uses the [FET token ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/native-and-erc20-fet-tokens) to facilitate transactions, agent interactions, and smart contracts execution, but it also to ensure that the integrity and efficiency of the Network is maintained.

In order to enhance the Ledger data accessibility, the Fetch Network employs an [Indexer ↗️](/concepts/fetch-network/indexer) which is based on **SubQuery**. The aim of the Indexer is to organize and index the Ledger data and provide a GraphQL API to enable developers to efficiently query and retrieve information for their applications directly from the Fetch Ledger.

### Jenesis

An additional tool is [Jenesis ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/jenesis/getting-started); it simplifies the development and deployment of smart contracts and decentralized applications (i.e., dApps) on the Fetch Network and other CosmWasm-enabled platforms. Jenesis offers a streamlined environment for developers that reduces the complexity of building blockchain-based solutions and accelerates the deployment of decentralized services and applications.

### CosmPy

As a complementary tool to the above ones, [CosmPy ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/cosmpy/install) is a Python-based library that facilitates interactions with Cosmos SDK-based blockchains, including the Fetch Network. CosmPy provides developers with a straightforward way to manage blockchain transactions, write and test smart contracts but also interact with agents; all within the familiar Python environment.

### Conclusions

These components together constitute the backbone structure of the Fetch Network. These tools are essential in enabling a decentralized economy of autonomous Agents and AI-driven Agent Functions. By leveraging the Fetch Ledger, Almanac Contract, FNS, Indexer, Jenesis, and CosmPy, the Fetch Network focuses on creating an environment where agents can autonomously manage tasks, interact with each other, and create value in a secure and scalable way.

The FET token empowers the Fetch Ecosystem, providing the economic incentive and governance framework necessary for the sustainability and evolution of the Network itself. The token acts both as the medium of exchange and the incentive structure for participants, while supporting the Network's governance and staking mechanisms.
