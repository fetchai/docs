      To provide a better service, the system needs you to share your current location. This allows DeltaV to enhance your experience by offering **more pertinent and personalized services based on your current context**.

      For instance, if you are looking for ride-sharing or flights services, DeltaV will require your location to provide precise options and estimates based on your current whereabouts, such as the nearest vehicle or airport available.

Next, you will be prompted to select a **Service Group** for the service you wish to query. You can choose the **All Service Groups** option if you are unsure about which category your desired service falls within.

Then, you need to choose an **objective** representing the desired task related to the service needed. If you do not see any objective for your request, select the **Something else** button and insert it manually within the **what are you interested about?** bar.

Once you provide this information, you will be able to proceed to the actual [DeltaV chat interface ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/deltav/deltav-chat-interface). This step provides the platform with information about the specific service you are seeking for (e.g., **Travel** or **Finance** related services).

Whenever ready, click on the **Start Chat** button to initiate the conversation with the **DeltaV AI Agent** and query for any service you require!
