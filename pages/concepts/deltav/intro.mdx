# DeltaV

## Introduction üöÄ

**DeltaV** is a groundbreaking platform developed by Fetch.ai, marking a substantial shift in AI-driven commerce and services delivery. This platform introduces a simple and user-friendly experience for both businesses and consumers to enroll and query services straightforwardly via an intuitive chat interface.

DeltaV platform operates as a search-based AI chat interface, employing natural language conversations to independently manage tasks for users. Its aim is to establish a direct link between businesses and customers, providing an extensive range of services, from booking flights and hotels to arranging cleaning services and more. DeltaV is poised to revolutionize the current e-commerce landscape by simplifying the integration process for businesses, enabling them to directly and easily connect their services within this Fetch.ai platform.

This integration is facilitated through the **core components** of this new Fetch.ai platform, starting with the [AI Engine ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro), [AI Agents ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agents/agents), and then the [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro) platform. In this context, the user queries for a service execution through DeltaV. AI Agents encapsulating services and registered within the Agentverse are retrieved using the AI Engine which selects the best agent among all of the available ones to execute the task related to the user's query. As it is possible to understand, each component plays a crucial role in delivering the most efficient experience possible to all users engaging with [DeltaV ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://deltav.agentverse.ai/login).

In this scenario, developers can employ Fetch.ai AI Agents technology and encapsulate **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Machine Learning (ML)** models, **existing APIs**, and other **business logic** to make businesses services accessible via DeltaV by registering them as agents within the [Agentverse Services ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services) section with Fetch.ai through the [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://agentverse.ai/) platform. This makes such services efficiently discoverable by users interacting with DeltaV's chat interface.

      This connection empowers companies to not only register their services but also presents a valuable monetization opportunity in this dynamic AI-powered landscape.

      **This integration of DeltaV with the other components of the Fetch.ai ecosystem orchestrates a unique symphony of agents, encompassing entities offering services and users eager to engage with them. Together, they collectively drive forward this transformative search paradigm.**
