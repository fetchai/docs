# DeltaV

#### _DeltaV operates as an AI search-based chat interface, employing natural language conversations to translate human inputs into a series of tasks to be executed. Its aim is to establish a direct link between users, providing an extensive range of services, from booking flights, arranging cleaning services, or query for information such as stock prices._

## Introduction üöÄ

![](../../../src/images/missing.jpeg)

**[DeltaV ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://deltav.agentverse.ai/login)** is a tool developed by Fetch.ai, marking a substantial shift in AI-driven commerce and services delivery. This platform introduces a simple experience for users to query for services directly via an intuitive chat interface.

We strongly believe that DeltaV is poised to revolutionize the current e-commerce landscape by simplifying the integration process for users, enabling them to directly and easily connect services through the Agentverse.

This integration is facilitated through the **core components** constituting this tool, starting with the [AI Engine ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro), [AI Agents ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agents/agents), and then the [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro) platform. In this context, the user queries for a service execution through DeltaV. AI Agents encapsulating services and registered within the Agentverse are retrieved using the AI Engine which selects the best agent among all of the available ones to execute the task related to the user's query.

In this scenario, developers can employ Fetch.ai AI Agents technology and encapsulate **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Machine Learning (ML)** models, **existing APIs**, and other **business logic** to make services accessible via DeltaV. This is possible by registering them as agents within the [Services ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services) tab with Fetch.ai through the [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://agentverse.ai/) platform. This makes such services discoverable by users interacting with DeltaV's chat interface.

      This connection empowers users to not only register their services but also presents a valuable monetization opportunity in this dynamic AI-powered landscape.

      **The collaboration between DeltaV and the Fetch.ai ecosystem brings together service providers and users, shaping a fresh approach to searching and interacting.**

DeltaV has the potential to craft customized AI-powered e-commerce experiences across a wide range of industries and services sectors,  meeting the different needs of users.

Start developing your AI Agents ideas to encapsulate services and register your agents within the **Agentverse: Services** to make such services retrievable on DeltaV. Checkout the dedicated guide for [registering agents as services ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services) or this dedicated [guide ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/running-locally) in case you are developing your agents locally.
