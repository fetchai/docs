## Introduction üöÄ

**DeltaV** stands as a groundbreaking platform developed by Fetch.ai, marking a substantial shift in AI-driven commerce. This platform introduces a simple and user-friendly experience for both businesses and consumers.

DeltaV platform operates as a search-based AI chat interface, employing natural language conversations to independently manage tasks for users. Its aim is to establish a direct link between businesses and customers, providing an extensive range of services, from booking flights and hotels to arranging cleaning services. DeltaV is poised to revolutionize the current e-commerce landscape by simplifying the integration process for businesses, enabling them to directly and simply connect their existing platforms and services within the Fetch.ai Ecosystem.

This integration is facilitated through the core components of the Fetch.ai platform, including the [AI Engine ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/ai-engine/ai-engine-intro), [AI Agents ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agents/agents), and [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/concepts/agent-services/agentverse-intro).

Developers can employ Fetch.ai AI Agents technology to encapsulate Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning (ML) models, existing APIs, and other business logic and make businesses services accessible via DeltaV by registering them as [Agentverse Services ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agentverse/registering-agent-services) with Fetch.ai through the [Agentverse ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://agentverse.ai/) platform. This makes such services efficiently discoverable by users interacting with DeltaV's chat interface.

**This connection empowers companies to not only register their services but also presents a valuable monetization opportunity in this dynamic AI-powered landscape**.

DeltaV has the potential to craft customized AI-powered commerce experiences across a wide range of industries and sectors, efficiently meeting the different needs of users.

The integration of DeltaV with the other components of the Fetch.ai platform orchestrates a unique symphony of agents, encompassing entities offering services and users eager to engage with them. Together, they collectively drive forward this transformative search paradigm.
