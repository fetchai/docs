For a list of tracked entities, see the [schema.graphql file ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/ledger-subquery/blob/main/schema.graphql).

To learn more about how to [run ↗️](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html) or [change this SubQuery Project ↗️](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/cosmos.html) to get your own custom GraphQL API for your app, [visit the SubQuery Academy ↗️](https://academy.subquery.network/) for documentation.
