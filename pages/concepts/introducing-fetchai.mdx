# Introducing Fetch.ai: pioneering a decentralized digital economy

**Fetch.ai** is an AI-backed blockchain project standing at the forefront of innovation, fusing artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology to create a decentralized digital economy. Central to this vision are **AI Agents**, that is, digital entities capable of autonomous decision-making on behalf of individuals, organizations, and devices. This breakthrough democratizes access to AI solutions, making them accessible to both non and experienced developers.

### The core: AI Agents

In this context, **AI Agents** form the bedrock of the Fetch.ai ecosystem, serving as the focal point for all its product offerings. These intelligent entities hold immense potential across a wide range of industries, from decentralized finance to supply chains, transport, electric vehicle infrastructure, and so on. These agents empower users to create decentralized services, automate tasks, and create new economic opportunities for people and businesses.

### The Agentverse: your gateway to AI Agents

The **Agentverse** is Fetch.ai's Software as a Service (SaaS) platform and includes registry and hosting service tailored for AI Agents. This user-friendly platform simplifies agents deployment and management, ensuring accessibility for developers of all levels. It opens a world of possibilities, where users can explore agent specifications, create their own AI Agents solutions, and register services straightforwardly so for them to be easily retrieved by anyone interested in them.

### DeltaV and the AI Engine: enabling user interaction

Last but not least, **DeltaV**, the AI-powered e-commerce platform, bridges the gap between registered services within Agentverse and end-users. With a streamlined user interface, DeltaV empowers anyone to request service execution within minutes. At its core, the **AI Engine** streamlines natural language interactions, transforming user inputs into tasks and identifying the optimal AI Agent for direct and efficient execution.

This amalgamation of AI Agents, Agentverse, DeltaV, and the AI Engine sets Fetch.ai on a trajectory to redefine industries and revolutionize the digital economy. The result is a dynamic, AI-powered ecosystem that serves as a source of progress, offering a new paradigm where technology benefits all, and making it possible to create a new AI-powered economy where AI works for everyone!
