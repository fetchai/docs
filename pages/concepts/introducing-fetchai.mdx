# Introducing Fetch.ai: pioneering a decentralized digital economy

**Fetch.ai** is an innovative project at the forefront of blending artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. At its core there are **AI Agents**, digital entities capable of independent decision-making on behalf of individuals, organizations, and devices.

The streamlined development process for AI Agents presents valuable opportunities for everybody: service providers can create customized, automated services, potentially streamlining operations, generating revenue, and directly connect with customers, whereas, end-users have the potential to directly engage with these services, bypassing traditional intermediaries.

Importantly, Fetch.ai emphasizes _accessibility_. Regardless of one's level of software development expertise, this technology aims to be inclusive and applicable to a wide array of use cases. This allows individuals and businesses alike to leverage the power of AI Agents for increased operational efficiency and innovation.

Fetch.ai's contribution extends beyond technological advancement. It signifies a shift in how we interact with and utilize AI within a decentralized digital economy. The potential to transform industries, empower service providers, and enhance users experience, offers a glimpse into a future where the benefits of AI are accessible to a broader audience of businesses and customers.

### The core: AI Agents

**AI Agents** are software programs that have the ability to make autonomous decisions and take actions on behalf of users within a decentralized digital economy. These agents are designed to interact with each other and the environment securely and autonomously. They serve as the foundational building blocks of the Fetch.ai ecosystem, enabling the creation of decentralized digital services, automation of tasks, and the generation of new economic opportunities across various industries, including but not limited to decentralized finance, supply chains, transportation, and electric vehicle infrastructure.

### The Agentverse: your gateway to AI Agents

The **Agentverse** is Fetch.ai's Software as a Service (SaaS) platform and includes registry and hosting services tailored for AI Agents. This user-friendly platform simplifies agents deployment and management, ensuring accessibility for every type of developer. It opens up a world of possibilities, where users can explore agent specifications, create their own AI Agents solutions, and register services straightforwardly so for them to be easily retrieved by anyone interested in them.

### DeltaV and the AI Engine: enabling user interaction

Last but not least, **DeltaV**, the AI-powered e-commerce platform, bridges the gap between registered services within Agentverse and end-users. With a streamlined user interface, DeltaV empowers anyone to request service execution in few clicks. At its core, we find the **AI Engine** which streamlines natural language interactions, transforming user inputs into tasks and identifying the optimal AI Agent for direct and efficient execution.

This landscape of AI Agents, Agentverse, DeltaV, and the AI Engine sets Fetch.ai on a trajectory to redefine industries and revolutionize the digital economy. The result of this is a dynamic, AI-powered ecosystem that serves as a source of progress, offering a new paradigm where technology benefits all, and making it possible to create a new AI-powered economy where AI works for everyone!
