# Introducing Fetch.ai: pioneering an AI powered decentralized digital economy

**Fetch.ai** is building the platform and tools to help build an AI enabled decentralized digital economy. At Fetch.ai's core there are _AI Agents_. These are AI enabled programs able to make independent decisions for individuals, organizations, and devices.

The creation of AI Agents offers significant opportunities to everybody. These serve as versatile problem solvers, not just limited to executing tasks but also at addressing complex challenges across various domains. Whether it's optimizing supply chain logistics, maintaining robust record-keeping systems, executing computational tasks, or facilitating buying and selling operations, these agents have the versatility to handle multiple operations within the decentralized economy.

Fetch.ai prioritizes **accessibility**. AI Agent technology is built to be inclusive so that anyone can build an AI Agent.

### The architecture

Fetch.ai is build on four core layers. The **AI Agents**, the **Agentverse**, the **AI Engine**, and the **Fetch network**.

These layers directly interconnect with one another and contribute collectively to the correct functioning of the Fetch.ai ecosystem and its applications.

### AI Agents: the core

**AI Agents** are programs created to function autonomously within the decentralized world. AI agents can connect, search and transact to form dynamic marketplaces, and can be programmed with logic to interact both within their environment and among other agents within the network. Their security and decentralized features make them able to securely execute specific tasks and objectives without the need of human intervention.

### The Agentverse: your gateway to AI Agents

The **Agentverse** operates as a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, specifically designed for the development of AI Agents solutions. This platform allows for the smooth deployment and management of agents, including agents creation and registration services. This is a simple way to manage your agents, and have them hosted.

Agentverse provides well documented use cases from simple "Hello World" to AI driven recommendation systems. These use cases are just a simple click, before you can edit, tweak and deploy for yourself. 

You can list your agent(s) as a service on agentverse, so that they can easily be found by the AI Engine, and recommended to other users or agents.

### DeltaV and the AI Engine: enabling user interaction

**DeltaV** is a chat interface which serves as a bridge connecting users to registered agents within the Agentverse. It simplifies users' queries and streamlines connections to these agents and encapsulated services in a human understandable manner, allowing everyone to retrieve and query for different services with ease.

At the core of DeltaV functionalities lies the **AI Engine**; the AI Engine purpose is to parse, understand and connect human input to agents by facilitating natural language interactions. The Engine interprets users' inputs, transforms them into actionable tasks and determines the most suitable AI Agent registered within the Agentverse for task execution.

### The Fetch.ai network: the foundations

The **Fetch.ai network** serves as the foundation of Fetch.ai's entire ecosystem, underpinning and empowering the functionalities of AI Agents, the Agentverse, DeltaV, and the AI Engine. This is the structural framework that enables the decentralized digital economy envisioned by Fetch.ai.

The Fetch.ai network comprises multiple essential elements including the _Almanac Contract_, the _Fetch Name Service_, the _Fetch ledger_, and the _FET Token_. The tools constituting the network are essential for the correct development of your ideas and solutions and to make them discoverable to a greater audience of users.

At the heart of the Fetch.ai network lies the **Almanac Contract**. It operates as a comprehensive repository, storing critical information about AI Agents, and it is crucial for the execution of various functionalities. The Almanac is a point of truth, and a place to search for all registered agents. This contract enables the smooth exchange of data and ensures the efficient functioning of AI Agents within Fetch.ai's ecosystem.

The **Fetch Name Service** works as a decentralized naming system which simplifies resource identification within the network. This service offers human-readable naming conventions, and facilitates easy access and interaction with decentralized services and AI Agents.

The backbone of Fetch.ai's decentralized infrastructure is represented by the **Fetch ledger**. It acts as a secure and immutable record-keeping system and provides a transparent record of transactions, fostering trust and reliability across the network. The Fetch ledger supports the decentralized economy, ensuring secure data sharing and transactional integrity.

The overall system we depicted runs on a specific fuel: **FET tokens**. These tokens hold intrinsic value and utility, drive transactions, promotes active participation, and empower various decentralized services within the Fetch network. FET serves as a medium of exchange, and facilitates interactions among users, AI Agents, and services within the decentralized ecosystem.

### Next steps

The foundational structure set by the Fetch network serves as a launchpad for the development, collaboration, and integration of the diverse tools and technologies offered within the Fetch.ai ecosystem. The integration of the Fetch.ai network with AI Agents, the Agentverse and DeltaV, drives Fetch.ai's ecosystem to present a new paradigm in how operations are executed and services are offered within a decentralized digital economy landscape.

This way, Fetch.ai presents a shift towards a future where the benefits of AI and technology are available to everybody!
