# Running an Agent with Docker

## Introduction


This example shows how to run an agent using the uAgents library inside a Docker container with Docker Compose. It walks you through setting up everything you need so you can easily build and run the agent.

## Agent with Docker 

### `agent.py`

This example demonstrates a simple agent-based communication system using the uAgents library. The `data_sender` agent sends a `DataPacket` message to the `data_receiver` agent every 4 seconds. Upon receiving the message, `data_receiver` logs it and sends an acknowledgment back to data_sender. Both agents log the messages they receive. The agents are running with Docker Compose using Docker.

```py copy filename="agent.py"

from uagents import Agent, Bureau, Context, Model


class DataPacket(Model):
    message: str


data_sender = Agent(name="data_sender", seed="data_sender recovery phrase")
data_receiver = Agent(name="data_receiver", seed="data_receiver recovery phrase")


@data_sender.on_interval(period=4.0)
async def send_data_packet(ctx: Context):
    """
    Event handler that gets triggered at regular intervals (every 4 seconds).

    Args:
    ctx (Context): The context in which the event is triggered.

    Returns:
    None: This function does not return any value but sends a DataPacket message from data_sender to data_receiver at intervals of (every 4 seconds).

    await ctx.send(
        data_receiver.address, DataPacket(message="Initiating data transfer")
    )

    await ctx.send(

bureau.add(data_sender)
bureau.add(data_receiver)

### `Dockerfile`

This Dockerfile sets up a Python environment with Poetry for dependency management. It installs necessary system packages, sets up the working directory, installs dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`, and runs `agent.py` using Poetry. The application listens on port 8000.

```Dockerfile copy filename="Dockerfile"
FROM python:3.12-slim
ENV PATH="$PATH:/root/.local/bin"

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl gcc && \
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org/ | python3 -

WORKDIR /app
ADD pyproject.toml poetry.lock /app/
RUN poetry install
ADD . /app
EXPOSE 8000

ENTRYPOINT ["poetry", "run"]
CMD ["python", "agent.py"]
```

### `docker-compose.yml`
This Docker Compose configuration builds and runs a Python app using Poetry. It maps the current directory to the container, exposes port 8000, and starts the `agent.py` script.

```yml copy filename="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    container_name: poetry_app
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    command: poetry run python src/agent.py
```

## Poetry Dependencies

```
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
uagents = { version = "^0.13.0", python = ">=3.10,<3.13" }
```

## How to Run This Example

- Navigate to the root Folder of the Example.
- Run `docker-compose build`
- Run `docker-compose up`

## Expected Output

```
