# On Query decorator example

This documentation outlines the steps to set up and enable communication between Agent and flask app based webpage, using the uAgents framework. flask app sends a query to Agent, and Agent processes this query and responds. Both agent and app use a simple request-response model for communication.

## Agent Script

### Agent Script

This agent handles queries related to job searches using SerpAPI. It provides information about available jobs for a job title specified by the user.

### Flask App Script

Async Agent-Based Flask App for Keyword base Job Search Results Retrieval.

```py copy filename="jobsearchapp.py"
import json

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from uagents import Model
from uagents.query import query

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define the address of your agent to send requests to
AGENT_ADDRESS = "<YOUR_AGENT_ADDRESS_HERE>"  # Update your agent address here


# Define a data model for incoming requests
class Request(Model):
    query: str


# Define a route to handle job search queries
@app.route("/search-jobs")
async def search_jobs():
    keyword = request.args.get("q")
    if not keyword:
        return jsonify({"error": "No query provided.", "status": "error"}), 400
    # Make a call to the agent with the request and handle the response
    response = await make_agent_call(Request(query=keyword))
    # Check if the response indicates an unsuccessful agent call
    if isinstance(response, str) and response.startswith("Unsuccessful"):
        return jsonify({"error": response, "status": "failed"}), 500

    try:
        # Parse the response to a Python dictionary
        job_data = json.loads(response)
        # Return the job data in a structured format
        return jsonify({"results": job_data, "status": "success"})
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        # Handle JSON decoding error
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid response format", "status": "error"}), 500


# Function to send a query to the agent
async def agent_query(req):
    try:
        response = await query(destination=AGENT_ADDRESS, message=req, timeout=15.0)
        # Decode the response and extract data
        data = json.loads(response.decode_payload())
        return data.get("response", "No data found")
    except Exception as e:
        # Return a formatted error message if the agent call fails
        return f"Unsuccessful agent call - {str(e)}"


# Function to initiate an agent call
async def make_agent_call(req: Request):
    response = await agent_query(req)
    return response


# Main function to run the Flask application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Steps to run the app
- Update `Agent Address` in `jobsearchapp.py` and [`serpapi_api_key`](https://serpapi.com/google-jobs-api) in `JobSearchAgent.py`.
- Run both the script `JobSearchAgent.py` and update the agents address in `jobsearchapp.py`.
- Rerun `JobSearchAgent.py` and `jobsearchapp.py` together
- Open new terminal window and run `curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/search-jobs?q=<your_job_serach_query>"`
- Replace `your_job_search_query` with your query in above command.

## Expected Output

- `JobSearchAgent.py`
