# Predefined Dialogue Chit-Chat

## Overview

This example illustrates an automated dialogue scenario using a hardcoded dialogue management system between two agents. The dialogue flow is predefined, minimizing the need for manual intervention or dynamic decision-making during the dialogue process.

## Step 1: Define the Dialogue management

`hardcoded_chitchat.py` sets up a structured dialogue system with predefined responses. This system includes nodes representing different states of the dialogue and edges defining possible transitions between these states.

- Open a terminal and create a directory using `mkdir Dialogues` and navigate into it with `cd Dialogues`.
- Create a python file `hardcoded_chitchat.py` in `Dialogues` directory:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
    ```py copy filename="mac"
    touch chitchat.py
    ```
</DocsCode>
<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > chitchat.py
    ```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch chitchat.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

</CodeGroup>
  
- Import required libraries.

    ```python
    from typing import Type
    from warnings import warn
    from uagents import Model
    from uagents.context import Context
    from uagents.experimental.dialogues import Dialogue, Edge, Node
    ```

- Define dialogue message models, each transition needs a separate message.

    ```python
    # define dialogue messages; each transition needs a separate message
    class InitiateChitChatDialogue(Model):
        pass

    class AcceptChitChatDialogue(Model):
        pass

    class ChitChatDialogueMessage(Model):
        text: str

    class ConcludeChitChatDialogue(Model):
        pass

    class RejectChitChatDialogue(Model):
        pass
    ```

- Define `nodes` (state) of dialogues like default, initiate, chitchat and end state.

    ```python
    # Node definition for the dialogue states
    default_state = Node(
        name="Default State",
        description=(
            "This is the default state of the dialogue. Every session starts in "
            "this state and is automatically updated once ."
        ),
        initial=True,
    )

    # Currently not used as states are measured by the edges
    init_state = Node(
        name="Initiated",
        description=(
            "This is the initial state of the dialogue that is only available at "
            "the receiving agent."
        )
    )

    chatting_state = Node(
        name="Chit Chatting",
        description="This is the state in which messages are exchanged.",
    )

    end_state = Node(
        name="Concluded",
        description="This is the state after the dialogue has been concluded.",
    )
    ```

- Define `edges` (transition) of dialogues like initiate session, start dialogue, continue dialogue and end session.

    ```python
    # Edge definition for the dialogue transitions
    init_session = Edge(
        name="initiate_session",
        description="Every dialogue starts with this transition.",
        parent=None,
        child=init_state,
    )

    start_dialogue = Edge(
        name="start_dialogue",
        description="This is the transition from initiated to chit chatting.",
        parent=init_state,
        child=chatting_state,
    )

    cont_dialogue = Edge(
        name="continue_dialogue",
        description=(
            "This is the transition from one dialogue message to the next, "
            "i.e. for when the dialogue continues."
        ),
        parent=chatting_state,
        child=chatting_state,
    )

    end_session = Edge(
        name="end_session",
        description="This is the transition for when the session is ended.",
        parent=chatting_state,
        child=end_state,
    )
    ```

- Define default behaviour for individual dialogue edges. Only the interaction that requires input from the user is exposed, making the other parts of the dialogue more robust and easier to maintain.

    ```python
    async def start_chitchat(ctx: Context,sender: str,_msg: Type[Model]):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received init message from {sender}. Accepting Dialogue.")
        await ctx.send(sender, AcceptChitChatDialogue())

    async def accept_chitchat(ctx: Context,sender: str,_msg: Type[Model],):
        ctx.logger.info(
            f"Dialogue session with {sender} was accepted. "
            "I'll say 'Hello!' to start the ChitChat"
        )
        await ctx.send(sender, ChitChatDialogueMessage(text="Hello!"))

    async def conclude_chitchat(ctx: Context,sender: str,_msg: Type[Model],):
        ctx.logger.info(f"Received conclude message from: {sender}; accessing history:")
        ctx.logger.info(ctx.dialogue)

    async def default(_ctx: Context,_sender: str,_msg: Type[Model],):
        warn(
            "There is no handler for this message, please add your own logic by "
            "using the `on_continue_dialogue` decorator.",
            RuntimeWarning,
            stacklevel=2,
        )

    async def persisting_function(ctx: Context,_sender: str,_msg: Type[Model],):
        ctx.logger.info("I was not overwritten, hehe.")
    ```

- In the provided code, specific message types associated with different dialogue states trigger predefined functions that manage the flow and actions of the dialogue, automating the transition between states and handling interactions within the dialogue system efficiently.

    ```python
    init_session.set_message_handler(InitiateChitChatDialogue, start_chitchat)
    start_dialogue.set_message_handler(AcceptChitChatDialogue, accept_chitchat)
    cont_dialogue.set_message_handler(ChitChatDialogueMessage, default)
    cont_dialogue.set_edge_handler(ChitChatDialogueMessage, persisting_function)
    end_session.set_message_handler(ConcludeChitChatDialogue, conclude_chitchat)
    ```

- Define `ChitChatDialogue` class and include nodes and edges into it. These acts as rule for chit chat dialogues.

    ```python
    class ChitChatDialogue(Dialogue):
        """
        This is the specific definition of the rules for the chit-chat dialogue
        The rules will be predefined and the actual messages will be passed into it.

        In this specific instance of the ChitChatDialogue, some parts of the dialogue
        are hardcoded, such as the initial message and the response to it.
        This is done to demonstrate that the dialogue can be defined in a way for
        developers to only focus on the parts that are relevant to them.
        """
        def __init__(
            self,
            version: str | None = None,
            agent_address: str | None = None,
        ) -> None:
            super().__init__(
                name="ChitChatDialogue",
                version=version,
                agent_address=agent_address,
                nodes=[
                    init_state,
                    chatting_state,
                    end_state,
                ],
                edges=[
                    init_session,
                    start_dialogue,
                    cont_dialogue,
                    end_session,
                ],
            )

        def on_continue_dialogue(self):
            """
            This handler is triggered for every incoming "chitchat" message
            once the session has been accepted.
            Any additional stateful information within a dialogue needs to be
            persisted explicitly to access it at a later point in the dialogue.
            """
            return super()._on_state_transition(
                cont_dialogue.name,
                ChitChatDialogueMessage,
            )
    ```

Include all the above mentioned script sections into a single script and save it as `hardcoded_chitchat.py`

## Step 2: setting up the agents

These two agents use the `hardcoded_chitchat` dialogue system to automate the interaction with minimal intervention. The dialogue is mostly automated, with `agent3` configured to respond to initiation and continue based on predefined rules, and `agent4` automatically initiating the conversation.
    
### Setting up `agent1`

`agent1` is designed to receive and respond to messages according to hardcoded rules within the ChitChatDialogue class.

    - Navigate to your working directory and create a Python script named `agent1.py`.
    - Copy the following script into `agent1.py`:
    
<CodeGroup hasCopy isLocalHostedFile>
    <DocsCode local={true}>

        ```python copy filename="agent1.py"
        # Import required libraries
        import json

        from uagents import Agent
        from uagents.context import Context

        from dialogues.hardcoded_chitchat import (ChitChatDialogue,
                                                  ChitChatDialogueMessage,
                                                  ConcludeChitChatDialogue)

        CHAT_AGENT_ADDRESS = "<your_agent_2_address>"

        agent = Agent(
            name="chit_agent",
            seed="<random_string_of_choice>",
            port=8001,
            endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit",
        )

        # Instantiate the dialogues
        chitchat_dialogue = ChitChatDialogue(
            version="0.1",
            storage=agent.storage,
        )

        # Get an overview of the dialogue structure
        print("Dialogue overview:")
        print(json.dumps(chitchat_dialogue.get_overview(), indent=4))
        print("---")

        # This is the only decorator that is needed to add to your agent with the
        # hardcoded dialogue example. If you omit this decorator, the dialogue will
        # emit a warning.
        @chitchat_dialogue.on_continue_dialogue()
        async def continue_chitchat(
            ctx: Context,
            sender: str,
            msg: ChitChatDialogueMessage,
        ):
            # Do something when the dialogue continues
            ctx.logger.info(f"Received message: {msg.text}")
            try:
                my_msg = input("Please enter your message:\n> ")
                await ctx.send(sender, ChitChatDialogueMessage(text=my_msg))
            except EOFError:
                await ctx.send(sender, ConcludeChitChatDialogue())


        agent.include(chitchat_dialogue)  # Including dialogue in agent

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            print(f"Agent address: {agent.address}")
            agent.run()  # Running agent

        ```
        </DocsCode>
</CodeGroup>
### Setting up `agent2`

`agent2` is configured to automatically initiate a dialogue with `agent1` using the predefined dialogue system.

    - Create a new Python script named `agent2.py` in the same directory.
    - Paste the following code into `agent2.py`:

<CodeGroup hasCopy isLocalHostedFile>
    <DocsCode local={true}>
        ```python copy filename="agent2.py"
        """Chit chat dialogue example"""

        from asyncio import sleep

        from uagents import Agent, Context

        from dialogues.hardcoded_chitchat import (ChitChatDialogue,
                                                  ChitChatDialogueMessage,
                                                  InitiateChitChatDialogue)

        CHIT_AGENT_ADDRESS = "<your_agent_1_address>"

        agent = Agent(
            name="chat_agent",
            seed="<random_string_of_choice>",
            port=8002,
            endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:8002/submit",
        )


        # Instantiate the dialogues
        chitchat_dialogue = ChitChatDialogue(
            version="0.1",
            storage=agent.storage,
        )

        @chitchat_dialogue.on_continue_dialogue()
        async def continue_chitchat(
            ctx: Context,
            sender: str,
            msg: ChitChatDialogueMessage,
        ):
            ctx.logger.info(f"Returning: {msg.text}")
            await ctx.send(sender, ChitChatDialogueMessage(text=msg.text))


        # Initiate dialogue after 5 seconds
        @agent.on_event("startup")
        async def start_cycle(ctx: Context):
            await sleep(5)
            await chitchat_dialogue.start_dialogue(
                ctx, CHIT_AGENT_ADDRESS, InitiateChitChatDialogue()
            )


        agent.include(chitchat_dialogue)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            print(f"Agent address: {agent.address}")
            agent.run()
        ```
        </DocsCode>

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Remember to update the agent's address to communicate to each other and seed phrase of own choice. 
    </Callout>

</CodeGroup>

## Step 3: Run the Dialogue

    - Start `agent1`:
        - Run `agent1` using `python agent1.py`
        - `agent1` will respond based on the hardcoded rules within the `ChitChatDialogue`. The interaction will continue until a predefined conclusion condition is met, such as an "exit" message or similar.
    <br></br>
    - Start `agent2`:
        - Run `agent2.py` using `python agent2.py`.
        - `Agent4` will automatically initiate the conversation with `Agent3` after a five-second delay.

## Expected output

- `agent1` logger/terminal output:

    ```
