# Running an Agent with Docker

## Introduction

This example shows how to run an agent using the uAgents library inside a Docker container with Docker Compose. It walks you through setting up everything you need so you can easily build and run the agent.

## Agent with Docker 

### `agent.py`

This example demonstrates a simple agent-based communication system using the uAgents library. The `data_sender` agent sends a `DataPacket` message to the `data_receiver` agent every 4 seconds. Upon receiving the message, `data_receiver` logs it and sends an acknowledgment back to data_sender. Both agents log the messages they receive. The agents are running with Docker Compose using Docker.

	```py copy filename="agent.py"

	 
	from uagents import Agent, Bureau, Context, Model
	 
	 
	class DataPacket(Model):
	    message: str
	 
	 
	data_sender = Agent(name="data_sender", seed="data_sender recovery phrase")
	data_receiver = Agent(name="data_receiver", seed="data_receiver recovery phrase")
	 
	 
	@data_sender.on_interval(period=4.0)
	async def send_data_packet(ctx: Context):
	    """
	    Event handler that gets triggered at regular intervals (every 4 seconds).
	 
	    Args:
	    ctx (Context): The context in which the event is triggered.
	 
	    Returns:
	    None: This function does not return any value but sends a DataPacket message from data_sender to data_receiver at intervals of (every 4 seconds).
	    """
	    await ctx.send(
	        data_receiver.address, DataPacket(message="Initiating data transfer")
	    )
	 
	 
	@data_sender.on_message(model=DataPacket)
	async def data_sender_message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: DataPacket):
	    """
	    Event handler that gets triggered when data_sender receives a DataPacket message.
	 
	    Args:
	    ctx (Context): The context in which the event is triggered.
	    sender (str): The address of the sender.
	    msg (DataPacket): The message received.
	 
	    Returns:
	    None: This function does not return any value but logs the received message.
	    """
	    ctx.logger.info(f"Data Sender received a message from {sender}: {msg.message}")
	 
	 
	@data_receiver.on_message(model=DataPacket)
	async def data_receiver_message_handler(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: DataPacket):
	    """
	    Event handler that gets triggered when data_receiver receives a DataPacket message.
	 
	    Args:
	    ctx (Context): The context in which the event is triggered.
	    sender (str): The address of the sender.
	    msg (DataPacket): The message received.
	 
	    Returns:
	    None: This function does not return any value but logs the received message and sends an acknowledgment back to data_sender.
	    """
	    ctx.logger.info(f"Data Receiver received a message from {sender}: {msg.message}")
	    await ctx.send(
	        data_sender.address, DataPacket(message="Acknowledging data transfer")
	    )
	 
	 
	bureau = Bureau()
	bureau.add(data_sender)
	bureau.add(data_receiver)
	 
	if __name__ == "__main__":
	    bureau.run()

    ```




### `Dockerfile`

This Dockerfile sets up a Python environment with Poetry for dependency management. It installs necessary system packages, sets up the working directory, installs dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`, and runs `agent.py` using Poetry. The application listens on port 8000.

	```py copy filename="Dockerfile"

	FROM python:3.12-slim
	ENV PATH="$PATH:/root/.local/bin"
	RUN apt-get update && \
	    apt-get install -y curl gcc && \
	    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org/ | python3 -
	WORKDIR /app
	ADD pyproject.toml poetry.lock /app/
	RUN poetry install
	ADD . /app
	EXPOSE 8000
	ENTRYPOINT ["poetry", "run"]
	CMD ["python", "agent.py"]

    ```



### `docker-compose.yml`
This Docker Compose configuration builds and runs a Python app using Poetry. It maps the current directory to the container, exposes port 8000, and starts the `agent.py` script.

	```py copy filename="docker-compose.yml"

	version: '3.8'
	 
	services:
	  app:
	    build: .
	    container_name: poetry_app
	    volumes:
	      - .:/app
	    ports:
	      - "8000:8000"
	    command: poetry run python src/agent.py

    ```


## Poetry Dependencies

```
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
uagents = { version = "^0.13.0", python = ">=3.10,<3.13" }
```

## How to Run This Example

- Navigate to the root Folder of the Example.
- Run `docker-compose build`
- Run `docker-compose up`

## Expected Output

```
