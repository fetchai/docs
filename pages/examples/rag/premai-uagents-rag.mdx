# PremAI RAG Agent

This example demonstrates the use of uAgents with Prem.ai to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system,  The agent handles health and wellness queries, providing informative responses. It integrates intelligent query handling with dynamic knowledge retrieval capabilities, making it a robust solution.

Please check out the example code in our [examples repo ↗️](https://github.com/fetchai/uAgent-Examples/tree/main/5-documentation/examples/intermediate/premai-rag-agent) to run this locally.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

To load the environment variables, use the following command:

- Navigate to the root directory and source the `.env` file by run `source .env`

### Example `.env` File

Here is an example of what your `.env` file might look like:

```bash
export API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

```

## PremAI RAG Agent Setup

### Overview of `query_prem_ai` function.

The `query_prem_ai` function is responsible for querying the Prem.ai API with a user's health-related question. It formats the user's input as a message, then sends the query to the API, which searches a specific repository for relevant responses. The function then processes the API's response, extracting and cleaning the content by removing unnecessary references (like citation numbers). In case of an error, it raises a runtime exception with a descriptive error message. This function enables the system to retrieve tailored health advice based on the user's input.


```py copy
prem_client = Prem(api_key=API_KEY)

def query_prem_ai(user_query):
    """
    Handles both initial and follow-up queries by calling Prem.ai API.
    """
    try:
        messages = [{"role": "user", "content": user_query}]
        repositories = dict(ids=[REPO_ID], similarity_threshold=0.25, limit=5)
        response = prem_client.chat.completions.create(
            project_id=PROJECT_ID,
            messages=messages,
            repositories=repositories,
            stream=False,
            model="gpt-4o",
        )
        final_response = response.choices[0].message.content
        cleaned_response = re.sub(r'\[\d+\]', '', final_response)
        return cleaned_response
    except Exception as e:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Error querying Prem.ai: {e}")

```

### PremAI agent mechanism

#### 1. User Agent (`user_agent`)

The `user_agent` is responsible for initiating the conversation and receiving the user's queries. It sends the query to the `prem_agent` for processing and displays the response back to the user. It also handles follow-up queries and the exit condition.

```py copy
user_agent = Agent(name="health_user_agent", seed="health_user_recovery")

@user_agent.on_event("startup")
async def send_health_query(ctx: Context):
    ctx.logger.info("[health_user_agent]: Sending initial query.")
    await ctx.send(prem_agent.address, HealthQuery(user_query=initial_query))

@user_agent.on_message(model=HealthResponse, replies={HealthQuery, ExitMessage})
async def handle_health_response(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: HealthResponse):
    ctx.logger.info(f"[health_user_agent]: Received response: {msg.response}")
    follow_up_query = input("Ask your next question (or type 'exit' to quit): ").strip()
    if follow_up_query.lower() in {"exit", "quit"}:
        await ctx.send(sender, ExitMessage(message="Exiting chat. Goodbye!"))
    else:
        await ctx.send(sender, HealthQuery(user_query=follow_up_query))
```

#### Explanation of `user_agent`

- The agent listens for a startup event, where it sends the first health query to the `prem_agent`.
- When it receives a response from `prem_agent`, it presents the answer to the user and asks if they have a follow-up question.
- If the user chooses to exit, it sends an exit message to end the conversation.

#### 2. Prem Agent (`prem_agent`)

The `prem_agent` processes the queries by interacting with the Prem.ai API. It retrieves the response from the API and sends it back to the `user_agent`. It also handles errors and exit messages.

```py copy
prem_agent = Agent(name="health_prem_agent", seed="health_prem_recovery")

@prem_agent.on_message(model=HealthQuery, replies={HealthResponse, ExitMessage})
async def process_health_query(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: HealthQuery):
    ctx.logger.info(f"[health_prem_agent]: Processing query: {msg.user_query}")
    try:
        response = query_prem_ai(msg.user_query)
        await ctx.send(sender, HealthResponse(response=response))
    except RuntimeError as e:
        await ctx.send(sender, ExitMessage(message="Failed to process query."))

@prem_agent.on_message(model=ExitMessage)
async def handle_exit_message(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: ExitMessage):
    ctx.logger.info(f"[health_prem_agent]: {msg.message}")

```

#### Explanation of `prem_agent`

- The `prem_agent` listens for `HealthQuery` messages from the `user_agent`. Upon receiving a query, it sends the query to the Prem.ai API for processing.
- After getting the response, the `prem_agent` sends the answer back to the `user_agent`.
- If an error occurs, the agent sends an exit message with the error notification.
