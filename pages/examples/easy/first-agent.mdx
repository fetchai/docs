# Create your first Agent

## Introduction

Welcome to your journey into the world of AI Agents! This example will equip you with the tools to create your very first intelligent agent using the uAgents Python library.

**Ready to get started?**

The code provided in this example can be run on any platform which supports Python with the necessary install permissions. As you progress throughout the examples, you'll get to understand topics in an increasingly difficult way.

Let's get started and explore the basic concepts you need to develop your first Agent!
