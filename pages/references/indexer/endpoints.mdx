## Endpoints / Playground UIs

The graphql API endpoints serve a playground UI to browsers for convenience. This UI is useful for rapid experimentation and iteration of queries as well as just getting some results. Features include:

    - Real-time query results.
    - Query editor:

        - Auto-complete & validation via schema introspection.
        - Can store multiple, named queries.
        - Supports graphql variables.

    - Local persistence of query editor contents.
    - Schema reference.
    - Graphql docs reference.
