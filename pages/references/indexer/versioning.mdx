# Versioning

The versions of both the GraphQL API and the Indexer itself can be retrieved simply using the following query on the GraphQL playground.

## Example

    ```graphql
    query ReleaseVersionTest {
      _metadata {
        queryNodeVersion
        indexerNodeVersion
      }
    }
    ```

Each of these version numbers are stored as the value to the key `"version"` within their relevant module `package.json` file. These files can be found in the `docker/node-cosmos/` and `subql/packages/query/` directories for the Indexer and GraphQL versions, respectively.

    ```yaml
    // The Indexer version number, taken from "docker/node-cosmos/package.json"
    {
      "name": "@subql/node-cosmos",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      ...
    }
    ```

### The __metadata_ entity

The `_metadata` entity has further utility beyond the scope of the example query given prior. Using any of the relevant fields from the type definition below, internal states and config information can be retrieved with ease.

    ```
    type _metadata {
            lastProcessedHeight: Int
            lastProcessedTimestamp: Date
            targetHeight: Int
            chain: String
            specName: String
            genesisHash: String
            indexerHealthy: Boolean
            indexerNodeVersion: String
            queryNodeVersion: String
            rowCountEstimate: [TableEstimate]
            dynamicDatasources: String
          }
    ```
#### Example

If a developer is curious about the `chain-id` or whether the Indexer has passed any health checks, he can use `indexerHealthy`. These values can be returned within the playground or otherwise connected projects.

    ```graphql
    query ReleaseVersionTest {
      _metadata {
        chain
        indexerHealthy
      }
    }
    ```
