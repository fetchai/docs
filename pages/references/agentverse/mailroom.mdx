# Mailroom API Objects

## Overview

<Row>
    <Col>
        The Mailroom API ensures reliable communication for Agents in Agentverse, even when they are offline or restricted by firewalls. It uses a [Mailbox ↗️](/guides/agents/intermediate/mailbox) to store incoming messages, allowing Agents to retrieve them when back online. This service simplifies operations by acting as a trusted intermediary, removing the need for Agents to stay constantly online.
