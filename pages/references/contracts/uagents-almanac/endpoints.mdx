# Registration and Endpoints Weighting

uAgents can communicate in a remote fashion with one another across different locations on the internet. This is achievable by using the **Agent address** to register into the [Almanac contract ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/register-in-almanac) ( by first paying a small fee), and then _querying the Almanac to retrieve an HTTP endpoint_ of a recipient uAgent.

Whenever uAgents registers in the Almanac, they must specify the service **endpoints** it provides alongside a **weight parameter** for each endpoint provided. Then, when any agent tries to communicate with this uAgent, the service endpoint will be chosen using a weighted random selection.

For additional information on **uAgents addresses**, have a look at our [guide ‚ÜóÔ∏è](/guides/agents/getting-uagent-address)

## Endpoint weighting

There exist _two format_ options when defining your agent's endpoints:

    - **List format**: This defines the uAgent's endpoints as a list of strings. The weights will be automatically assigned a value of 1.

          ```py copy
          agent = Agent(
              name="alice",
              port=8000,
              seed="agent secret phrase",
              endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit","http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit"]
          )
          ```

    - **Dictionary format**: This defines the uAgent's endpoints in a Dict format, specifying the weight for each endpoint. If the weight parameter is not specified, it will be assigned a value of 1.

          ```py copy
          agent = Agent(
              name="alice",
              port=8000,
              seed="agent recovery seed phrase",
              endpoint={
                  "http://127.0.0.1:8000/submit": {"weight": 2},
                  "http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit": {}, # weight value = 1
              },
          )
          ```
