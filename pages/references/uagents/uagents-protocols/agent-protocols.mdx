# Agents protocols

Within the uAgents Framework, `protocols` support capturing related message types and handlers.

Protocols are used to facilitate communication and interaction between agents in the Framework.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Indeed, any agent including the same protocol will be able to communicate with each other.
    </Callout>

A `protocol` is built similar to an agent, but it has no identity and cannot be run. Protocols only contains the message types and handlers that define some components of an agent's functionality.

Let's use a _simple restaurant table booking request_ as an example to better understand what a protocol means and how to build one:

1. Let's start by creating a folder for our **protocols**. Then, let's create Python script within it, and name it:

   `mkdir protocols`

   and 

<CodeGroup hasCopy isOSFile>
<DocsCode mac={true}>
```py copy filename="mac"
touch book.py
```
</DocsCode>

<DocsCode windows={true}>
    ```py copy filename="windows"
    echo. > book.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>

<DocsCode ubuntu={true}>
    ```py copy filename="ubuntu"
    touch book.py
    ```
    </DocsCode>
</CodeGroup>

2. We import from `uagents` library the necessary classes `Context`, `Model`, and `Protocol`. Then, need to define the type of messages that the handler will receive and send:

   ```py copy
   from uagents import Context, Model, Protocol

   class BookTableRequest(Model):
       table_number: int

   class BookTableResponse(Model):
       success: bool
   ```

   We use the `Model` class from `uagents` library to define `BookTableRequest` and `BookTableResponse` classes for setting up the structure of messages to be exchanged between your agents. The `BookTableRequest` class represents a request to book a table, containing the desired table number, while the `BookTableResponse` class represents the response to that request, indicating whether the booking was successful.

3. Now, we would need to define the booking protocol as `book_proto` and also define the desired logic to determine if the `BookTableResponse` will be successful or not:

   ```py copy
   book_proto = Protocol()

   @book_proto.on_message(model=BookTableRequest, replies={BookTableResponse})
   async def handle_book_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: BookTableRequest):
       if ctx.storage.has(str(msg.table_number)):
           success = False
       else:
           success = True
           ctx.storage.set(str(msg.table_number), sender)

       # send the response
       await ctx.send(sender, BookTableResponse(success=success))
   ```

4. We can then import our booking protocol from into the script we create for our agent, in the following way:

   ```py copy
   from protocols.book import book_proto
   ```

5. If your agent is called `restaurant` you can include the protocol in this way:

   ```py copy
   restaurant.include(book_proto)
   ```

For a better understanding of these concepts, consider having a look at the [Agents storage ↗️](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/storage) and [Exchange protocol ↗️](/references/uagents/uagents-protocols/exchange-protocol) resources and consider going through the extensive [How to book a table at a restaurant using agents ↗️](/examples/table-booking-demo) guide in the [Agents guides ↗️](/guides#ai-agents) section. Also, checkout the [Agents: broadcast ↗️](/examples/broadcast) for an additional implementation of protocols in agents communication.
