# μAgents Storage 

μAgents storage is an important concept to understand how μAgents work. You can use the **Context** object to modify storage information related to your μAgent. While writing the code for your agent, you can add within an event handler, different methods retrieved using `ctx` (i.e., the agent's `Context` object) to retrieve and edit storage values.

For instance, you could use the **set** method of the **Context** class to set the μAgent's local storage by simply running:

```py copy
ctx.storage.set("key", "value")
```

This will save the information in a **JSON file**. This information can be retrieved at any time using the **get** method of the **Context** object:

```py copy
ctx.storage.get("key")
```

For a practical understanding of the concept of storage, have a look at the [Using μAgents storage function ↗️](/guides/agents/storage-function) guide in the μAgents guides section for a step-by-step example showing how to retrieve and set storage values.

The [How to book a table at a restaurant using uAgents ↗️](/guides/agents/booking-demo) and the [How to use the μAgents to simulate a cleaning scenario↗️](/guides/agents/cleaning-demo) guides in the [uAgents Guides ↗️](/guides#agents) section, instead, show a more complex and real-world demonstrations making use of the μAgent's storage.
