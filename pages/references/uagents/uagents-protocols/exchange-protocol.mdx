# Exchange protocol

## Overview

The **Exchange protocol** is a protocol designed as part of the Fetch.ai uAgents Framework. It defines a standardized method for communication between agents within the agents ecosystem.

The Exchange protocol enables agents to exchange **messages** using a **JSON-based format**, which are structured as key-value pairs following the JSON standard. Messages can contain various types of information and are used to convey data and instructions between agents.

Within the protocol, **envelopes** facilitate communication by encapsulating messages. Envelopes serve as containers for the messages and include additional metadata.

In this protocol, gents can send **messages** enclosed in **envelopes**, which are then encoded and sent via HTTP to the [endpoints ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/endpoints) of other agents.

By adhering to the agents Exchange Protocol, agents within the Fetch.ai uAgents ecosystem can communicate with each other using a standardized and interoperable method.

We break down each of these concepts in more detail below.

## Core concepts

### Messages

Messages consist of key-value pairs following the standard JSON format.

Here are a few examples:

    ```json
    { "message": "hello" }
    ```

    ```json
    { "name": "alice", "age": 26, "languages": ["English", "Japanese", "Arabic"] }
    ```

    ```json
    { "item": "pretzel", "bid": { "amount": 120, "denomination": "GBP" } }
    ```

Once messages are created, these are enclosed in envelopes containing some important metadata.

### Envelopes

Envelopes have the following form and are quite similar to blockchain transactions:

    ```py
    @dataclass
    class Envelope(BaseModel):
        version: int                     # Envelope version
        sender: str:                     # Bech32-encoded public address of the sender
        target: str:                     # Bech32-encoded public address of the target recipient
        session: UUID4                   # UUID of the session
        schema_digest: str               # Digest of the schema used for the payload
        protocol_digest: Optional[str]   # Optional protocol digest for custom protocols
        payload: Optional[str]           # JSON payload encoded as a base64 string
        expires: Optional[int]           # Unix timestamp in seconds indicating expiration
        nonce: Optional[int]             # Optional nonce
        signature: Optional[str]         # Bech32-encoded signature
    ```

### Semantics

    - The `sender` field exposes the address of the sender of the message.
    - The `target` field exposes the address of the recipient of the message.
    - The `protocol` contains the unique schema digest string for the message.
    - The `payload` field exposes the payload of the protocol. Its JSON representation should be a base64 encoded string.
    - The `expires` field contains the Unix timestamp in seconds at which the message is no longer valid.
    - The `signature` field contains the signature that is used to authenticate that the message has been sent from the `sender` agent.

Envelopes are then JSON encoded and sent to endpoints of other agents or services.

### Endpoints

The protocol supports only one standardised endpoint: `HTTP 1.1 POST /submit`, and expects data which is broadly JSON compatible.
