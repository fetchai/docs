# Hosting API

<div className="nx-text-fetch-content">
  Welcome to the Hosting API documentation.
</div>

## Overview

<Row>
    <Col>
        The hosting API allows you to manage your agents that are hosted by Agentverse. This involves creating new
        agents, updating the code of existing agents, starting and stopping agents, and getting logs of agents.
    </Col>

## Notable Objects

### The Agent Object

<Row>
    <Col>
        <Properties>
            <Property name="name" type="string">
                The given name of the agent. This is only a label that is used internally so users can keep track of
                their agents.
            </Property>
            <Property name="address" type="string">
                The address of the agent. This is also the current public key of the agent.
            </Property>
            <Property name="running" type="boolean">
                The current state of the agent. `true` if the agent is currently running, `false` otherwise.
            </Property>
            <Property name="compiled" type="boolean | null">
                The current code compilation status for the agent. `true` if the agent is compiled, `false` if the
                compilation failed, `null` if the agent has not been compiled yet.

                The current digest of the code of the agent. Useful for determining if there have been code changes that
                need to be applied to the agent.
