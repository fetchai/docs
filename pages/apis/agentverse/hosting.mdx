# Hosting API

<div className="nx-text-fetch-content">
  The Hosting API empowers users to manage their Agents on Agentverse. From creating and updating Agents to control their states and access detailed logs, this API offers comprehensive tools for efficient Agents management. Users can also retrieve usage statistics, monitor individual Agent performance, and ensure that their Agents operate as intended with up-to-date code.

  This documentation provides an in-depth overview of available endpoints, notable objects, and practical examples, enabling developers to interact with the API effectively. Whether you're creating new Agents or managing existing ones, this guide will help you unlock the full potential of the Hosting API. 
  
  You can see our dedicated object reference documentation [here ↗️](/references/agentverse/hosting).
