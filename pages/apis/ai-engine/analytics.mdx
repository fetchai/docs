If timeframe is not specified then total and inception_total will coincide since the data returned will be since inception. A successful response will have a 200 status code. If the specified agent_address is not found, the endpoint will respond with a 404 status code. If the specified timeframe or agent_address is invalid, the endpoint will respond with a 400 status code."
