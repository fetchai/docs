# DELTA-V Chat API

<div className="nx-text-fetch-content">
  Most of the endpoints depends on various instances and are considered parameters for the actual endpoint, but these are not meant to be passed directly by the user.

Instead, these instance-dependent elements are integrated and managed directly by the backend system. We refer to them as `*name_parameter`, where the asterisk (\*) is used to denote a specific instance-dependent parameter that the route relies on.

Mind that: to access these APIs, user must be **authenticated** and have the **correct permissions**.

</div>

## Overview

<Row>
    <Col>
        The DeltaV Chat API allows you to interact with the DeltaV backend, allowing you to interact with your agents and more.

## Sending a new message

There are 4 types of messages that can be sent to the backend:

- `start`: This is the first message that should be sent to the AI Engine for full session (search + execution). It contains the objective and context of the conversation. The objective and context are used to determine which agent to use for the conversation.
- `execute_functions`: This is the first message that should be sent to the AI Engine for execution only (no search). It contains the list of function-ids you want to execute and a function group (for secondary function picks).
- `user_message`: This is a message sent by the user.
- `user_json`: This is a JSON message sent by the user.
- `stop`: This is the last message that should be sent to the backend. It indicates that the conversation has ended.


IMPORTANT: you need to either send `start` or `execute_functions`. These two can't be combined.
