# Course Introduction 
This course is designed to guide and instruct you through your initial agent development journey.
As you move along through it you’ll begin creating increasingly sophisticated agents. The course  encompasses: definitions, essential concepts, best practices, and guides you through the installation, setup, and creation of progressively intricate and valuable agents. 

## Introduction to Agents  
The uAgents (micro-Agents) Framework is a lightweight framework that allows individuals and enterprises to create and deploy AI agents in a variety of industries including in decentralized contexts. 
By definition agents are software entities that carry out some set of operations on behalf of a user or another program with some degree of independence or autonomy, and in doing so, employ  knowledge or representation of the user's goals or desires. 

In practical terms, agents enable individuals and organizations to automate a wide range of workflows, from simple to complex, by leveraging a combination of artificial intelligence, API calls, blockchain technology and sophisticated business logic. 

## Setup and installation 
Setups are the initial hurdle of any software endeavor.
Just like in soccer where a proper goal-keeper is half the team, a smooth initial setup is half the journey. And since teamwork makes the dream work if you face any unexpected challenges join  our [Discord↗](https://discord.gg/fetchai) where a team member will assist you. 

If you’re new to Python development this is everything you need to know in a nutshell.  Python is an interpreted language that requires a Python interpreter and tools to manage your virtual environments and packages. Python is also an ecosystem full of useful downloadable packages. 
The uAgents package which is the subject of this course can work in combination with other packages and libraries such as the Requests library. 

Here’s a list of all the tools you may need to maximize your productivity and master the creation of agents. 

1. IDE: Visual studio or PyCharm (any will work) 
2. Homebrew: Latest Version
3. PyEnv: Latest Version
4. Python: 3.8+
