# Connecting to a blockchain 🔗

Once you have installed CosmPy, you can connect and begin interacting with Cosmos-based blockchains, by running the following:

    ```py copy
    import cosmpy
    from cosmpy.aerial.client import LedgerClient, NetworkConfig

    # Connecting to the Fetch.ai mainnet
    ledger_client = LedgerClient(NetworkConfig.fetch_mainnet())
    ```

In the code snippet above, we are using the `LedgerClient` as a client object which takes a `NetworkConfig` as an argument. For ease of use network configurations are provided automatically. For example, `NetworkConfig.fetch_mainnet()` is the configuration for the Fetch ledger. However, CosmPy allows you to customize the network configuration and interact with other chains. You can explore a full list of chain identifiers, denominations and endpoints at [chain registry ↗️](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/).

Below, you can find an example of a custom network configuration:

    ```py copy
    cfg = NetworkConfig(
        chain_id="cosmoshub-4",
        url="grpc+https://grpc-cosmoshub.blockapsis.com:429",
        fee_minimum_gas_price=1,
        fee_denomination="uatom",
        staking_denomination="uatom",
    )

    ledger_client = LedgerClient(cfg)
    ```
