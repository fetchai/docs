# How to add profiles

## Introduction

A contract **profile** is a contract configuration setting that defines various parameters related to a specific network or environment where a contract will be deployed and interacted with.

## Walk-through

You can add more profiles than the one specified using the `new` command, presented in [getting started ↗️](/guides/fetch-network/jenesis/getting-started), by running the following `add profile` command:

    ```
    jenesis add profile my_second_profile
    ```

By default, the profile's network will be set to `fetchai-testnet`, but you can specify it using the `--network` optional argument. The following data will be added to the existing information in your `jenesis.toml` file:

    ```toml
    [profile.my_second_profile.network]
    name = "fetchai-testnet"
    chain_id = "dorado-1"
    fee_minimum_gas_price = 5000000000
    fee_denomination = "atestfet"
    staking_denomination = "atestfet"
    url = "grpc+https://grpc-dorado.fetch.ai"
    faucet_url = "https://faucet-dorado.fetch.ai"
    is_local = false

    [profile.my_second_profile.contracts]
    ```

At the moment, the available network configurations are `fetchai-testnet`, `fetchai-mainnet`, and `fetchai-localnode`, but Jenesis is easily configurable for other networks by directly editing the `jenesis.toml` file.

In the snippet above, a profile named `my_second_profile` is added with default settings for the `fetchai-testnet` network. This allows developers to easily switch between different network configurations when deploying or interacting with contracts.
