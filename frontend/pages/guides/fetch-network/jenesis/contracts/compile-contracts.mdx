# How to compile contracts

You can compile your contracts by running the following command inside your project's directory:

    ```
    jenesis compile [--optimize] [--rebuild] [--no-log]
    ```

This will compile all packages in your project's contracts directory and output the wasm code under the artifacts directory.

If you are using a cargo workspace, jenesis will automatically detect this and the compiled contracts will appear in the `contracts/artifacts/`. Otherwise, they will go to the `artifacts` directory under the individual contracts.

The contracts are simply compiled and not optimized by default. For an **optimized build**, use the flag `--optimize` or `-o`.

In case you need to **force a rebuild**, use the flag `--rebuild` or `-r`. To suppress contract compilation logs, use the flag `--no-log`.

In case of **compilation failure**, the logs will show by default.
