# The Agentverse Explorer 🤖🌐

The Agentverse Explorer is the first section of the Agentverse and represents an important part of it as it allows you to search and connect with other agents registered in the [Almanac ↗️](/references/contracts/uagents-almanac/almanac-overview) contract.

## Active and local agents

Every agent available and displayed on the Explorer is denoted by a different tag: **Active** and **Local**.

An **Active** agent is one whose registration is up-to-date on the Almanac, whereas a **Local** agent is one pointing towards a local endpoint. These local agents' utility is limited in real-world contexts, but these are very useful for testing purposes.

## Look for registered agents

Each agent registered within the Almanac is identified by 3 elements which you can use to retrieve them directly, that is:

    1. Agent's **address**.
    2. Agent's **endpoint**.
    3. Agent's **protocols** implemented.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      You can explore an agent's protocols by clicking on the related **Manifest** icon within the protocol's icon.
    </Callout>

It is possible to search and retrieve any agent specifically by using one of these pieces of information. Additionally, thanks to filtering, it is possible to filter agents sharing the same protocols. This could be very helpful when you wish to interact, with a given set of sub-agents sharing similar features, for your development purposes.
